s08e05	Well, it was thoroughly uninteresting.You know with all the hype created around this episode, for it to be better than The Great War, you’d expect atleast some sort of redemption from the producers.Let’s break it down:Varys betrays Dany and she burns him alive - and Jon and Tyrion witness it first hand and still go into battle. And when she goes all Mad Queen they’re still surprised?I still can’t believe the steep character shift they brought about for Dany either. She decides to kill everyone and rule using fear just because Jon didn’t make love to her, come on!The Euron and Jamie fight scene - it was absolutely unnecessary and an absolute waste of screen time. Actually, a lot of shots in this episode were a huge waste of screen time. Arya is running about witnessing the war, gets up on a horse and rides into the dust - I guess green eyes is Dany which doesn’t even make sense cause Dany’s supposed to have Violet eyes.The hound and the mountains fight was the only watch-worthy scene that came out of this episode.And God, please don’t tell me that’s how Jamie and Cersei die, that would just be pathetic.Amidst all of this, Tyrion has walked into the city and we don’t know what’s going to happen.So all in all, the review scale for GOT this season has been dipping by the episode and I have no hopes that the final episode will be any better.
s08e05	Not much in the way of depth commentary this time around. Just a few more thoughts on one major arc (spoilers), then quick takes and Reddit highlights.#1: “And the end of that way is death.”There are many ways in which Game of Thrones (and perhaps ASOIAF itself) isn’t a classic greek tragedy. But there’s one rather conspicuous way in which it is, which I think the showrunners deserve some credit for committing to.If we were paying attention, Dany’s heel-turn, though overly sudden, wasn’t quite a turn. Her fate was mechanical — the necessary outcome of her fatal flaw meeting an environment sure to exploit it. She was deformed long ago by a game almost perfectly suited to exacerbating her central drive (which had been reinforced by her trauma into something like Valyrian Steel). The only question we’ve been left with was whether someone could help her see it before she crossed her final Rubicon.Well, it’s been increasingly obvious this season that help was not on the way, and that, as I went into last week, her dim view of wheel-breaking was the noose that would eventually hang her. Others have added similar commentary in recent days, two instances of which I think are worth reading:This Reddit thread tracks her major decisions from S01 onward, demonstrating how the seeds for this were planted long ago.This Twitter thread is gold (though I’d quibble with its use of the term “genocide”). While I highly recommend all of it (not super long), I’ll include a few of the money quotes here:  That said, my being in favor of Dany’s arc isn’t quite the same as being in favor of how D&D handled it. While I agree with Twitter Carl that Dany may end up as GRR Martin’s greatest achievement, I’d argue that S08 fell not a little short in meeting that potential vis-à-vis her on-screen presentation.Briefly, I think everything up until the bells was consistent with her character, Varys included. But the bells themselves? Waaaaay too far, waaaay too fast. In her own words from last week: “let the people see that Daenerys Stormborn made every effort to avoid bloodshed.” For her to pivot from this to burning the Red Keep and a few Lannister soldiers with a handful of civilian casualties along the way? I suppose we could get there. But burning residential blocks and civilians en masse? Just feels like an example par excellence of the lazy sort of writing that’s undercut this entire season.What gets me most is that even with the compressed timeline, lots of these same beats could have been hit in better ways with just minor adjustments. Take Rhaegal’s downfall. Why not make it about Dany’s impulsivity vs. “well, she forgot about the enemy she’d just discussed with her advisors twelve seconds ago”. As an alternative: she dives towards the ships to burn them in the moment, Euron waits until she’s committed to have his men pull sailcloth off the ballistas, they fire, Rhaegal goes down, Dany barely escapes. Same outcome, and all you lose is a fractional amount of surprise in exchange for greater character logic and overall realism.In the case of her Mad Queen reveal, I thought one of this week’s Reddit leaks (I couldn’t help myself) that turned out to be untrue was actually far cleverer writing. The theory was that Cersei would simultaneously ring the bells while blowing up small caches of wildfire near the walls, thus making those on the ground believe that Dany/Drogon were responsible. Would have been a chess move totally consistent with Cersei’s evil, and would have given Dany some kind of logical pretext for going off the handle (i.e., “if innocents are going to die and I’m going to be blamed anyway, I’m going to burn this city to the ground so Cersei doesn’t win”).Anyway, I hope D&D’s mishandling doesn’t undermine her arc (though I fear it might), as it really is a great bit of writing. If we didn’t see it coming, it’s because we didn’t want to. While her worst instincts were occasionally tempered by those around her, she hasn’t really learned anything. Her first instincts are still fire, blood, and destiny — which speak to the ancient moral about “there is a way that seems right unto a man, and that end of that way is death”. Her only salvation would have been someone recognizing and tending to her traumas — but she never allowed that, and the game itself wasn’t designed to promote intervention and contemplation anyway. Her downfall thus sets up the installation of a new form of government able to eliminate the creation of more Danys, which the current game produces with the regularity and physics of a pendulum swing.(To give the show some credit, saving Dany as the final baddie feels apropos. The real enemy is forever the common impulse within all of us that’s one or two really bad days away from being used as pretext/justification, along with the broken social systems that make recovering from those bad days so difficult. The “dark ages” weren’t one era of the past; they’re the recurring result of us neglecting all the great lessons of history. Unexamined ideas and abandoned insights are the loss of that which separates us from the apes. Ruling is more long division than poetry, and we either confront our hatred of maths or we don’t, and so on.)Anyway, enough sermonizing.#2: In Other NewsGreat title: “The Last War”. Clear callback to how people called WWI “the war to end all wars”, which was similarly misguided. (EDIT: Apparently the correct title is “The Bells”, which honestly feels pretty silly.)Using Arya as ground-level POV was brilliant. And maybe her experience will be enough to make her reconsider Gendry’s offer?Um, did Davos actually help smuggle Jaime somewhere? And, if so, what’s his motivation for treason? It’s not like Davos has some special love for the Lannisters. If Tyrion somehow convinced him, that scene would be important. And does this mean that Davos is on trial alongside Tyrion next week too?When your goal is sneaking into Enemy HQ, maybe you should use your “I can wear other people’s faces” trick? Especially if you’re going to walk alongside one of the most recognizable people in Westeros.Technically, Arya has been saying she would kill “the queen”, not necessarily Cersei. Obvious setup for her going after Dany. That said, I think Jon having to do it fits the narrative better, which means her thing is (hopefully) just a red herring. (Like a million people on Reddit brought up the whole “behold a pale horse, and upon him sat death” thing. We get it. But see previous objection.)Dany wasn’t totally wrong about Jon being an idiot. He’s basically Ned: charmingly (and frustratingly) committed to some old school form of nobility, and otherwise generally myopic.I suppose criticizing the show on the level of military strategy is beating a dead dragon at this point, but, like, the point of having walls is usually to have your fighters on the other side. (Also, were those ballistas on the walls only for Drogon? Seems they could have mowed down a lot of Unsullied and Dothraki while the Golden Company were just kinda waiting for Godot or whatever.)On a related note: the Golden Company weren’t, uh, all that good at fighting. Like, did they score a single kill? Not that they had a real chance of winning — but they went down pretttty easily.I thought the Battle of Winterfell II left like eight Dothraki and maybe a dozen Unsullied alive, all of whom were dealing with pretty severe injuries and general war fatigue. Yet they all teleported to King’s Landing and increased in number like 500x along the way?That Aaron Rodgers cameo (blink and you missed it) was so on the nose it hurt — never getting a chance to impact the game because his defense was so overmatched. I’ve seen that movie before. [EDIT: Apparently he was actually a random peasant, not a Golden Company soldier. Ah well. The joke stays.]One more thing about Dany’s arc — it’s the dark side of that “those who have a why can bear any how” bit. Sometimes your why is perverse, but it helps you survive anyway.Hard to understand why they wasted the film necessary to record Qyburn’s line about it maybe not being totally safe to remain in an open window right by where a dragon was 9/11-ing all the nearby buildings.In like manner, Cersei had this curious lack of urgency in all her movements. Like, sure, shock and hubris and whatnot. But she’s a survivalist, and she knew the basement was her only chance. Why waltz her way down there? (Though, as one commentor styled it, her “Theresa May-ing” past Sandor was good fun, if also tonally weird.)Cleganebowl was ok. Though I guess less impactful when you know The Mountain can’t be allowed to win outright. Kept the whole Oberyn 2.0 gag from being a real scare. Even so, good ending I suppose. Solid unmasked Darth Vader makeup too.Euron giving Jaime the (kinda) mortal blow? Sure, why not. But letting Jaime come back from certain death to get there? Whhhhhhhy?About Jaime — so Dany’s troops don’t stop him from entering Winterfell, but do somehow catch him on the road leaving it? Wouldn’t he have just lied about where he was going?Ramin’s music for this (and Westworld) is all-time brilliant. Just so good. Especially the end credits.Why did Tyrion turn in Varys when he was about to commit a treason of his own? (Like, I get that his treason wasn’t planned out at that point — but the fact that he responded to two similar circumstances so differently, one immediately after the other, just isn’t credible.)I guess I owe $50 for Jaime not saying “the things I do for love”, despite it being the perfect moment when he met Cersei in the keep. Someone name a fitting charity and I’ll donate. Anyway, great ending for him. Remember the scene with Edmure Tully? This is who he is, in all his ugly complications. (That said, his “I don’t care about the innocents” line was especially dumb, as both his kingslayer moment and his initial abandonment of Cersei were predicated on protecting innocent lives. But that’s S08 writing, I guess.)#3: Reddit Has Some Notes(This honestly feels like a super legit point. Reckon there must be what — like 5,000 little girls out there named after Daenerys? Whoops.)(Also, this was one of like 374 posts to make this comment. I arbitrarily picked this one because I liked the use of the meme. But I’m not crediting the user, as they clearly took the core joke from someone else.)Reference clip for above:(The incel line is pretty harsh. But D&D kinda did open the door for it by using Jon’s not-totally-rejection as major impetus.)EDIT: Ok, a few more that were too good to not include.(Like, his plan — treasonous as it was — did actually work. But he got two things wrong: he over-estimated both queens, which is pretty par for the course at this point.)EDIT #2: Ok, a few more again, just for therapy.(I include this because I think it is what the showrunners meant to communicate. But it was done too subtly, I think. More concerning though: I’m not sure what the storytelling point is of Dany being even worse than Aerys? Her story is a tragedy. Any amount of monstrosity would do the trick. This still feels overkill.)(This is the silliest explanation I can conceive of for how they handled her turn. Honestly makes me a little embarrassed for them.)(No deeper meaning with this last one. Just made me feel happy, like the episode didn’t.)
s08e05	As usual this is part review, part recap, and I wrote it on the fly while watching so not every observation pans out:First thought, from the other side: I hate being right all the time.Jon is a fucking idiot.Tyrion is a fucking idiot.Can we call Dany a Mad Queen now? I would have previously rejected something so loaded but … I think she’s earned it? Honestly, I don’t want to hear another goddamn fucking word about Dany’s benevolence, her good intentions, her birthright, her abolitionist wanderings, or anything. If you want to delude yourself into thinking GRRM doesn’t have something pretty much like this in mind for the books too, and that D&D 100% pulled this out of your asses, that’s your damage. Spare the rest of us the bullshit. I’m done.Everyone keeps telling me the show is trying to get me to root for Jon, but I don’t see how? Because he’s a fucking idiot? What are we rooting for here?Varys is writing messages and it’s clear what they say. None of them are in evidence later when he’s caught. Had he been sending them out the whole time? Dead man’s switch?Here’s the Jon-Varys beach scene. It threw me off guard to see Jon arriving at Dragonstone but I guess he had veered off from Davos and the troops to come there. On the one hand it’s believable that Varys would put out feelers for Jon. On the other, it’s insane that he’d do so so openly, with Tyrion literally watching them, and I’m amazed Varys didn’t already know Jon was an idiot.I’m honestly surprised that Tyrion narced on Varys. I thought he’d sit on it and see how things went. The fact that he told on Varys so soon makes me think Varys was right; if he was wrong he could have had some comeuppance later. As it is he looks like a martyr. (What happened to all those scrolls?)Dany looks like hell, understandably. She’s quite like her father here. Everyone’s turned against her, everyone’s a betrayer. Tyrion thinks that narcing early might save him and it … might not? Maybe?Did … Jon not know Dany would kill Varys with Drogon? He seems taken aback by what happened but also doesn’t seem too fussed, as I’d’ve guessed he wouldn’t be if it were “just” Varys.Here’s Dany pretty much openly threatening Sansa again, this time for telling the truth about Jon. It looks even more unhinged than her panicking about it at Winterfell. Funnily Jon seems neither angry nor surprised at his sister. Did he want her to tell? Did he know all along that she would? The thing is that, as I pointed out elsewhere, Dany freaking out about Sansa telling and getting all threatening about it just proves that Sansa’s instinct to tell was right. Dany would not stop feeling edgy even if the secret never got out — she’d always be waiting for the other shoe to drop, and eventually she’d decide that Jon was better off dead. Sansa forced it out in the open rather than give Dany the chance to knock Jon off like a rat in the shadows.Dany whines that no one loves her here and Jon says he does, and why? At this point, why? What’s he getting out of this? He’s just seen her burn a guy alive and she’s hinting pretty damn strongly that she’d like to do the same thing to his sister. What’s it gonna take? I can sort of see Jon loving the mysterious girl who came to his rescue on a dragon and blah blah, but this? He rejects her sexually, again, so what the fuck is his play here?“Let it be fear.” Yet another Rubicon crossing.Interesting that Tyrion and Grey Worm are counseling her in the throne room but not Jon. She has little consideration for the people in the city now and thinks that the “real” mercy is preventing future people from living under a tyrant, i.e. Cersei. Sure.The Targaryen lines caught Jaime and now Tyrion looks scared shitless. Looks a bit different when someone you actually love is on the line, huh. Dany says if Tyrion steps out of line again she’ll kill him, and he looks like every pathetic scab who ever ratted out people above him before finally following them to the block. Hope it was all worth it.Tyrion and Jon join up with Davos. I see Vale shields.It took a really long time but someone finally remembered that Davos is a smuggler.Arya and Sandor ride up and Arya declares that she’s here to kill Cersei. She’s … probably not gonna kill Cersei.Tyrion bullshits his way to getting access to Jaime. “Did you consider taking it off?” Fair question.This is pretty much Tyrion signing his own death warrant. Tyrion appeals to Jaime’s child to try to get him to talk sense into Cersei. Tyrion is literally telling Jaime how to commit fuckin’ treason with Cersei. This isn’t even “feed to my dragon” territory. This is “flaying alive” territory. Bit cheeky for Tyrion to rat out Varys and then do this, isn’t it?This plan won’t work will it? As soon as you plan, shit happens.“Your queen will execute you for this.” No “she’s your queen too” retort. Tyrion thinks Dany will be happy just to take the city easily. He’s … also an idiot? Why is every man around Dany an idiot?As other people guessed, Tyrion’s love for Jaime eventually outweighed his loyalty to Dany.Here come the scorpions.Arya and Sandor have made it into the city. Does anyone know they’re there? Jon?Here’s the shot from the trailer with the hooded man and the Golden Company. People guessed from the trailer that the hooded man was Jaime but guessed too that he was their prisoner and that they’d be taking him to Cersei. Nope!What is the time scale here? Jaime and Arya can’t both kill Cersei. I doubt this is being set up so one of them kills her and then nothing happens. How are we filling the next 50 minutes?I want it on the record that Dany’s foot soldiers have literally just arrived at King’s Landing and they’re already getting thrown at the 100% fresh Golden Company. Good idea!Jon, Davos, Tyrion and Grey Worm are standing behind. Tyrion tells Jon to call everyone off if the bells ring. Jon’s back in his Stark armor. Meaningful?Cersei doesn’t look very panicked. Civilians keep pouring into the Red Keep. Everyone’s trying to get in and … why’d they close the gate?Ah, so Arya and Sandor got in but not Jaime. So much for Tyrion’s plan.So, uh, if Arya kills Cersei. No one knows to ring any bells, right? That was just between Jaime and Tyrion? Uh?Euron and his ships. I’m gonna be honest, I’m ready for this fucker to go.Euron’s ships are toast but it looks like he may have made it off in time? Going by the show’s standards.It looks like Dany used Aegon I’s Harrenhal maneuver: get really damn high and then plummet down.Dany finally remembered how her dragon works. Cool.The Golden Company and Dany’ forces are standing outside measuring each other’s dicks.Dany blows the gate open, and here we go.Bye, Harry Strickland. We hardly knew ye.LOL Dothraki plowing through King’s Landing while Dany lights it on fire. “Let it be fear” indeed.It looks like for now that Dany’s focusing on the Lannister and GC soldiers. It’s really interesting seeing the destruction close up, and it looks huge, but then you see it from Cersei’s perspective and think, “Wow, this really is a massive-ass city.”Tyrion yet again wandering through one of Dany’s hellscape wastelands and looking like he’s not sure how he got here. I have an idea.Now it’s Cersei’s turn to get backed into a corner. I think the Red Keep might fall today?Some real Jets/Sharks action going on here with Dany’s men and Cersei’s. I half-expected a dance-off.What the hell is Davos doing here? Isn’t he not that much of a fighter? Is it just that much of a rout that he thinks he’s safe?Jaime’s still trying to get in.I have a bad feeling about Arya and Sandor both already being in.The Lannister forces see Drogon and decide they’ve had enough. Jon’s relieved. Imagine if he had to make a morally questionable decision.Here come the bells. Or the demands for the bells at least.Is Cersei being spiteful as shit here or does she have something up her sleeve?This was all too easy, wasn’t it? Drogon showed up, burned through everything, the GC was a big fat nothing, Dany burned some non-civilian targets and now the bells are going off.What’s the catch.What’s the catch?!Here’s the catch?Dany’s flying to the Red Keep. It looks like Bran’s vision from earlier!Here’s the Mad Queen moment. Dany had the city, the bells were going off, it’s not going fast enough to her liking (I guess?!) and she flies onward and keeps burning stuff. This is like shooting a guy who’s lifted a white flag. I want it to be CLEAR what this is.Hi, these are civilians who are being burned alive. The bells have already gone off.Tyrion is shocked, shocked I say. The fuck did he think would happen?The Lannister forces have dropped their weapons. Grey Worm kills one and it’s open season on them after that.Jon, like Tyrion, looks shocked. Jon, like Tyrion, is a fucking idiot.Well, this is a slaughter. The Lannisters had already put their swords down.Grey Worm sees Jon telling his men to stay back.I get that Grey Worm is emotionally compromised here. But goddamn it.Dany’s still burning shit. She’s doing exactly what Cersei wanted her to do. Congratu-fuckin’-lations, you goddamn fucking idiot.Here’s Davos and Jon trying to control the situation, Davos is trying to get people out of the way.Isn’t this what wasn’t supposed to happen if Dany used the Unsullied?Hi, Dany is fucking burning civilians here. After the bells have gone off. Are we all clear on this? Because I want to be 100% fuckin’ clear on this: DANY IS BURNING CIVILIANS. (Anyone wanna litigate Sansa telling Tyrion about Jon again? No?)You still love her now Jon, you fucking idiot?Jon kills anyone coming at him but otherwise just stands there slack-jawed and watching shit go on around him.Jaime’s still wandering around and he finds the dinghy that was left. There’s Euron. This is gonna be stupid isn’t it?There goes the Red Keep. Amazing that Dany saw all this in the House of the Undying and it was her all along. *chef’s kiss*“The Red Keep is the safest place in the city,” as the Red Keep gets dismantled.Do Qyburn and Cersei have any other plans?There’s the wildfire! You knew they had it around somewhere.Jaime, kill the fucker. Come on. This is not the time to dick around.Arya and Sandor are in the Red Keep. They might want to get out? I love Arya but she’s not thinking clearly here. Sandor is trying to talk sense into her.So Jon has no idea Arya is here does he.“Sandor?” “Thank you.” Oh man. The feels.There are all those holes in the ceiling that Dany saw in Qarth. Groovy!Clegane Bowl time.Bye, Qyburn.Gregor finally sees something he gives more of a shit about than Cersei.I feel like both Gregor and Sandor are going to die here. Be funny if they just had a big blast of fire take them both out.Here’s Jaime and Cersei together again. Valonqar time?This is weirdly touching. The castle is literally falling down around them but they still have that connection. It’s nuts.How do you kill an UnGregor?Arya’s leaving. This is chaotic and crazy. Terrific camerawork here following Arya through the city and seeing everyone dead, injured and terrified.What the fuck does Dany even think she’s doing here? Is she just going after Cersei? Is she just angry? The bells have already rung, for shit’s sake. What is she achieving here? Terrifying people? She apparently meant what she said by “let it be fear.”Juxtaposing Arya against Sandor is really cool, editing- and composition-wise.“Fucking die!” Sandor saying what we all think.OH GOD HE’S DOING THE OBERYN THING.Off they go, flying into an inferno. Godspeed, Sandor.Here’s dipshit Jon again. Fire’s going off and so is wildfire. It’s unclear if they left caches of it around just for this, or if Dany’s catching all the leftover shit from her dad’s reign. Either way, this makes everything worse.Does Dany not think to stop when she sees wildfire going off? Does she not think that she has her own men in the city, including Jon and Davos and Tyrion?Jon looks a bit sick. Still love her, Jon?Jon’s finally had enough. Wonder if he thinks he should have taken Varys up on the offer when it was open.Arya, covered in blood and dust. She’s alive but … temporarily? Eep?Are they … are they going to Primrose Everdeen Arya?There goes the bell tower. Well no one was using it I guess?Arya’s trying to get refugees moving. They all get ridden down by Dothraki. Arya just led this poor woman to her death.Jaime and Cersei are down in the basement, trying to get out. While it is true that Cersei brought the bulk of this on the city herself, it’s also true that the fucking bells rang and Dany kept lighting shit up anyway.Cersei ends up cutting a rather pathetic, frightened figure. Cue tragic “Rains of Castamere.”That’s the end for them both, but no choking involved. Are we … are we calling this the valonqar?Every time I think they’re going for the “aftermath,” shit keeps getting fired up.How in the shit is Arya still alive?Well Arya, the bad news is that you can’t kill Cersei anymore. The good news is that there may be a replacement?This shot of Arya and the horse is beautiful. Is this death? It looks like death. I really can’t tell if this is Arya actually dying or if she really did find the one horse left alive in King’s Landing. I guess it’s the latter?Final thoughts: Dany went further here than I ever thought. Straight up. My take was that she’d obliviously blow the Red Keep, not knowing there were people inside. Or that Cersei would trick her into lighting up wildfire and blame her for it. Or that Cersei would hold out for so long that Dany’s hand would be forced. Never in my wildest dreams would I have guessed that she’d get the city to surrender — ring the bells — and then blow it all to shit anyway. Tyrion and Jon are both pretty much beneath my contempt at this point. Varys was right. Sansa was right to get the truth out about Jon; if Dany did this, she would have eventually lost it with regard to Jon’s parentage. The Lannister twins’ demise was much more bittersweet than I’d’ve thought — I feel like a lot of people expected him to kill her in anger but I like the way they did it here. I’m processing still how I feel about that.Cersei’s gone and Dany’s path to the throne is open. But she’s destroyed the city and not a single person in it will ever forgive her for it or see her as anything less than a pscyhotic lunatic. “I’m saving you from future tyranny!” shrieked the lady on a dragon burning people alive. I mean, Jesus Christ.I cannot wait for the “Well Dany burned up King’s Landing and killed probably thousands of civilians, but Sansa told Tyrion about Jon!” takes. Bring them on, please. I could use a laugh after that. Are we going to see Varys’ dead man’s switch? Will Jon and Tyrion — who’s now lost Jaime when he might otherwise have gotten Cersei out if Dany had just waited — finally grow some fucking balls? Will Jon find out Arya came really fucking close to dying?So I guess the being prediction next episode is who gets to put Dany out of her psychotic misery. Did they save Arya for that? Will Jon and Tyrion take responsibility for what they did?
s08e05	Ashes to AshesKing’s Landing is dead, long live King’s Landing. Dany unleashing her inner Targaryen and turning the once resplendent capital of the Seven Kingdoms into the world’s largest KFC order was harrowing and horrifying yet entirely in tune with her character. She always has been a dormant volcano kept in check by those near and dear to her, and now that she has neither, well, Vesuvius ain’t got shit on her.Yes, it was rushed and ill-executed, but the seeds were there. If only they had taken more time and allowed the turn to feel more organic.She is now officially the big bad of Game of Thrones; she is the endgame, and I hope she gets what’s coming for her – Arya Stark, the newly reborn Lady of Winterfell.The Fast and the FuriousThe frequently cited issue of the show feeling rushed in its last two seasons has reached critical mass now. Jaime altogether abandoning over five seasons of character development and Brienne going from stoic badass to a ‘mewling quim’ in the previous episodes were egregious examples of rushed pacing. Make no mistake, both those outcomes are entirely natural, yet they undoubtedly felt abrupt.In this episode, while Dany’s descent into darkness is understandable, giving it more time would have led to a more potent turn.I almost forgot Jon and her are supposed to be in love. When he said “I love you,” it suddenly hit me “Oh yeah, that’s still a thing.” We are shown that Jon eventually spurning her advances serves as the trigger because until then she feels at least she has Jon, but when he rejects her, that’s when the “Let it be fear then” side of her genuinely comes out.This didn’t work. Partly because Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington have no chemistry whatsoever and partly because we haven’t seen them in love. Jon snowed her in the season 7 finale, and after that, they’ve just had that solitary dragon riding scene.Arise Arya Stark, Lady of WinterfellA girl has a name, and now, a girl has an identity. We saw in this episode, after what feels like ages, Arya’s ‘human’ side. Her heroism and her desire to save the people above all costs.When she bid farewell to Sandor, she bid farewell to her life as an assassin as well. But there is the matter of that one last kill. She’s going after Dany. But this time, it’s not for personal vendetta, it’s to save the Seven Kingdoms from the tyranny of the now mad Queen.The cinematography, particularly towards the end, was stunning. Props to Maisie Williams, who was completely believable in that climactic scene – in a state of shock as the world crumbles around her.And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunderOne of the four beasts saying, come and seeAnd I looked, and behold, a white horseThe name that sat on it was death, and hell followed with herThere’s a storm coming Queen Daenerys, first of her name, burner of women and children.And her name is Arya Stark.
s08e05	It was extremely fun to watch but I was disappointed at lots of ways.Varys-We all knew he’d die this way, if he ever dies. I’m disappointed at Tyrion’s actions. Varys saved from his trial. I’d expect better from Tyrion.But Varys played the game. He wrote the first later at day, when Jon arrived. He probably sent the first Letter long ago from his execution. We will see a pay-off of it.Tyrion- He realized Varys was right. I loved what he did for Jamie. Makes sense. I also loved his effort to save the innocent. Dany wasted it, sadly.Battle- No Golden Company fight Scene?! Really? Drogon burning Euron’s fleet was good. I liked Jon’s attitude during the Battle, Fall Back!Jamie ve Euron part was good. I liked it.Cleganebowl was the best thing in the whole episode. Great booking. The Desperstion of Sandor was brilliant. Killing his brother by burning him, Poetic Justice. The ending was really good. I was really horrified that the Mountain will to the same thing he did to Oberyn to the Hound too. The Hound’s attitude was amazing. “Fucking Die” The Visuals was the best in the whole series. Epic booking.Cersei and Jamie-Did I saw it wrong or did they really died? I am really shocked.The Last words was amazing.Before that, “I dont want to die” part from Cersei was great.“I want our baby to live. Jamie, dont let me die.”“Nothing matters but us”Really Moving. I loved it. Can be done better but Brilliant still.Arya Stark will kill Daenerys.Remember that.Seeing the destruction was incredible.The scene of the mother and daughter was well done.Seeing the horror in the eyes of the girl slayed the Night King was amazing.She knows It was Dany’s fault. (I hope showrunners won’t say Daenerys turning to the Villian was the 3rd big plot twist.) She will definietly kill her. They foreshadowed it before:
s08e03	As usual, part recap, part review. And obvious spoilers are obvious. This is unchronological, stream of consciousness, gut reaction, by the way. Additional thoughts labeled as EDIT.We have a title now: The Long Night. Apropos.Holy shit.Arya Stark will never need to buy another beer in Westeros ever again.Holy shit.Hey now we know why Bran made a point of giving Arya that Valyrian steel dagger.That may have been the most intense 80-ish minutes of TV (or film, even) I’ve ever seen.First off: I openly admit I had Melisandre pegged entirely wrong. I wondered where she was (and in hindsight it seems obvious she’d show up right in the nick of time) and thought perhaps her focus on the Others had been a misdirection. Silly me.Was anyone else … surprised … that the Dothraki ended up being so absolutely useless? Like absolutely useless such that … why were they even there? How many of the wights everyone ended up fighting were just all those Dothraki? I think most of us probably saw the Dothraki as cannon fodder, but to that extent? Was that all of the Dothraki, apart from women and children? Are the Dothraki literally wiped out as a civilization now? (Does anyone care?) LOL they made this huge inspirational deal of Melisandre lighting up their arakhs and … it was a giant popcorn fart.EDIT: Thinking about the Dothraki more, it makes sense that they’d flame out terribly. Why? Their potency is rooted in psychological terror. You see a bunch of screaming horsemen riding you down swinging sickles and yeah, you’re gonna shit yourself and run and be mown down. But the wights don’t know fear or self-preservation. They can’t be psychologically cowed. So a Dothraki charge means nothing to them and in turn the Dothraki are deprived of what makes them effective. I think that’s a large reason for why the Unsullied did comparably so much better; they’re trained to withstand psychological trauma but also to be more effective in more tangible ways, i.e. they don’t rely on unleashing terror to take down enemies but they’re also less likely to cut and run in the face of an enemy like the wights.I just want to point out that we didn’t actually see Ghost die. Ghost is probably dead. But we didn’t see it. I can’t tell if Ghost is actually alive still or if this is their way of killing him off with minimal CGI work. Neither would surprise me. EDIT: Someone pointed out that he’s visible in the trailer next week and HE IS unless there’s another wolf-shaped thing at Winterfell:LOL I would love to know the story of how Ghost goes from running with the Dothraki — literally like “Oh God he’s gonna die isn’t he” — to apparently peacing the fuck out of there and I guess napping in the woods for the rest of the battle?I guess a new family has to get Bear Island now. I said earlier Lyanna Mormont was too awesome to live and, well. Glad she took out that wight giant beforehand.I would have liked to have seen more engagement with the Others themselves. After a certain point the wights were just kind of mind-numbing, you know? Seeing Jorah or Brienne or Arya fighting actual Others would have been cool.I cannot believe they did the dumbfuck zombie Starks thing. Yeah, wights are strong, but skeletons breaking out through goddamn stone? There were plenty of ways for the crypts to end up dangerous that didn’t require that to happen. Like there are wights all the hell over the place, surely some of them can get into the crypt from above. As soon as that happened I said out loud, “Are you fucking kidding me?”Tactically, I don’t think the dragons were used all that well. (Blame Jon, I guess?) Like Dany brushing Jon off to go burn up wights is, without exaggeration, probably the best thing she’s ever done. Why in the hell were the Dothraki sent into … that … when the dragons could have flown out early and wiped out the first few waves?Pretty much everyone I thought would live ended up living, but several people I thought were on the block — Grey Worm, Brienne, Davos, even Tormund, Podrick, Gendry or Gilly — also made it. Who’d we lose? Lyanna Mormont, Edd, Jorah and Theon (probably the biggest character losses), and Beric. Did I miss anyone? It feels like someone else or a few someone elses should have died, right? The overall body count was massive, but the Big Players’ body count was, considering the circumstances, pretty low, yes? EDIT: And Melisandre, duh.Now I will always wonder if the writers knew Arya would kill the Night King way back in season 3 when we got the “blue eyes” line, or if it just worked out that way. The callbacks there (that and “not today”) were incredible. I’m so glad Arya made it and so glad she ended up doing that.I’m glad we got the dragons fighting. It looks like both Drogon and Rhaegal survived, which I was a bit surprised by. I figured Viserion would go, although I thought the living dragons would kill him. I also thought though that one of the two living dragons would be killed, likelier Drogon. (For everyone rooting for a mini Dance of the Dragons, stranger things have happened.)I’d’ve liked to have seen Sansa and Tyrion do a bit more down in the crypts, especially since Arya made such a point of giving Sansa a weapon. I did like their exchange though and their little moment while they were hiding. It was sweet, non-romantic (good) and a genuinely affectionate interaction.Varys did, again, virtually nothing. What are they holding onto him for? I thought his end might be tied in with Melisandre’s, but apparently not.Melisandre going out into the snow to die felt “correct,” in that her work was done and she’d finished what she’d meant to do, but it also felt a bit unearned. I’m turned off that the story seems to have validated her religious zealotry, and disappointed that she never really got any proper comeuppance for the terrible things she’s done, namely killing Shireen. She got to show up in the eleventh hour, do what she’d always wanted to do, and then die feeling accomplished. She didn’t deserve it so good.I also have to admit — in conjunction with my takeaway that the dragons weren’t used too well overall — I expected Jon and Dany to both do “more” than they did. I know that seems odd given that they burned up a ton of wights, but … they didn’t stop Viserion from landing in Winterfell, they didn’t light up the trench, they didn’t stop the wights from getting through the flaming trench. They provided cover for the retreat, but most of the big on-the-ground moments — the trench being lit, defending Bran in the godswood, holding the castle, and so on — fell to other people. They were overall supporting. I guess that should make me happy, as I’d said before that dragons weren’t the only way to fight the Others and they might have limited potency (see: the Night King withstanding Drogon’s fire; who would have predicted that a few years ago?), but now I’m wondering what the two of them will actually be doing in the future.Theon and Jorah’s deaths were touching and earned. Bran telling Theon he was a “good man” really got me, and I may think that Dany is probably Trouble but Jorah doesn’t, so I’m glad he got to go out defending her. That’s how he’d want to go, no doubt. He deserved to leave the way he’d have wanted, and thank God they didn’t turn him into mulch with the Dothraki.Even now I can feel my mind running ahead to the fallout. Like Grey Worm — they had to have been playing with the “two days to retirement” trope there, deliberately — and Missandei. They won, they both made it. Do they carry out the plan they made or does that fall by the wayside? Do Dany and Sansa start getting on better after this? Does Dany need to conscript surviving northmen to replace her army that’s now been annihilated? Does she have to lean harder on having Drogon? Does Jaime stick around with Brienne?We should also step back and take stock of the Night King theories. Unless there’s some double-cross coming, like Bran has to take over the Night King’s mantle or be created as a “new” Night King, the “Bran is the Night King” theory looks pretty dead. We never did get to see who this figure really was or, really, what he actually wanted besides the sweeping explanation Bran gave last week. Does this mean the third “holy shit” moment isn’t related to the Others? Will we get more detail about the Others in the books? Whither the “prince that was promised” prophecy? Was it Jon just because Jon was in charge of this, did it fall by the wayside, or will it refer to something else entirely?Finally, the writers had two options here. They could have written this battle as being a loss, with the survivors having to evacuate and fight another way (and in another episode). Or they could have done a true self-contained battle. They went with the latter. That not only makes me wonder how the last half of the season will be filled (and it looks like the next episode takes place pretty quickly after the Winterfell battle, i.e. no time jump), but what will happen in episode 5, which Sapochnik is also directing. I’m guessing that’s another battle episode; funny how it looks like nothing from after this battle made it into any of the promotional material. Why?EDIT: So uh what is Bran going to do now? Other than giving Arya the dagger last season (and in theory she could have done the same thing with obsidian, which everyone was given), did he even do anything? He has this absolutely immense power, apparently, and he … what? Uses a few ravens to see what’s going on when that should already be obvious? Is he going to go back to his tree? Are we, sweet Jesus, actually going to get that ridiculous “Bran’s the new Night King” theory? Or is his actual utility spreading the truth about Jon?Final thoughts: Just really tremendous, technically and in terms of scale and characterization. Everyone got to have a moment and it felt like someone took Blackwater, Hardhome, Bastard Bowl and Castle Black and tossed them into a blender. It will take me a while to fully process it and I know I’ll have to watch it again soon as I no doubt missed some stuff.
s08e03	I suppose this episode did leak after all …… to a fictional character about a year and a half ago.The mystery of the blue raspberry sauce from undead Viserion is also cleared up …… undead Viserion’s fire is made of purest Fridge Logic.*Fridge Logic - TV TropesNo wonder Cersei had no concern whatsoever about the Night King and his Army of the Dead. It sounded scary. It sounded impressive. It should have been impressive …. and then they were totally lamentable.The Night King and his Army of the Dead were so very shit that five minutes in the Dothraki were stadium-rock-arms-aloft ready to sing along with ‘Candle in the Wind’.The time before the Night King showed up was mostly devoted to trolling him.The Unsullied were probably all making the universally recognised ‘Dickhead’ gesture in unison, but the night being dark, and the Army of the Dead terrible ( - not in good way), saved the Night King a few blushes, should he ever get round to watching the action replay of whatever it was that happened at Winterfell.Battle feels like the wrong word.That the first five minutes were devoted to Sam miming that he ought to have put woolly gloves on, in a situation where Sam would totally have been wearing woolly gloves, was not a good sign.Sam spent much of the ‘battle’ doing the worm like a man who knows he’s wearing plot armour.I suppose that he and the Dothraki must have been looking over Cersei’s shoulder when she was reading about the magnitude of the Night King’s lameness. It’s a wonder that he ever managed to get to Season Eight.I think the Night King might be Victarion.If we take a step back to after Sam’s my-hands-are-cold, but before Dothraki stadium-rock-arms-aloft ready to sing along with ‘Candle in the Wind’ and ask ourselves the question:Who lit the candle substitutes of the Dothraki to enable their stadium-rock-arms-aloft ready to sing along with ‘Candle in the Wind’ trolling of the Night King?That would be Melisandre who gave her presence away by having her pseudonym in the opening credits.She materialises on the field of play, walks up to the Dothraki, who forget they hate magic, and allow her to grope their arakhs whilst she’s rhubarb-rhubarbing, and the rest is all ‘rrrahh!’ and Charge of the Lit-Up Brigade.Ser Davos, who will mistake himself for an air traffic controller in a world without aeroplanes in 3–2–1, looks disapprovingly in Melisandre’s direction and then says:‘Open the gates!’Of course he does.Tough luck Soup Girl - Davos forgot he was so invested in you.I guess he was looking over the Dothraki’s shoulders a year and a half ago.‘No need to execute me, Ser Davos’.I bet Charles I, Marie Antoinette, Joan of Arc are kicking themselves for not thinking of saying that prior to the curtailment of their respective lifetimes.Dany and Jon take to the air on Drogon and Rhaegal.They are flame-mowing the ‘Army of the Dead’ in stripes like they are the groundsmen at Lords’ Cricket Ground …… and here comes the Night King on Wight Viserion.The blasts of Blue Raspberry Sauce do not freeze or incinerate the humans fighting for the living, nor do they make them dead.The weather in the local area gets a bit inclement, but in a think-twice-about-having-a-picnic sort of way, rather than ‘run for your life’.Nor are the White Walkers particularly impressive.The White Walker Hippie Patrol comes forward, but they literally have no skills.They are more useless than the walking corpses.I am so glad that White Walker II - RIP, U is with with angles now - the greatest White Walker that ever was, or will be, died Beyond the Wall when to be a White Walker meant something. He would have hated to have seen how lame his brethen had become.Edd dies, whilst Sam is still doing the worm.Honestly, nobody ought to be dying from Team Winterfell here.Edd should not be dead and that one’s on Sam.Every single one of the home team’s deaths is totally unnecessary.Still, I suppose, that the ‘Army of the Dead’ have the numbers.There’s a ‘fall back’ from Brienne and a ‘close the gates’ from, I don’t know, maybe Tormund. Neither of them had better die. Not here. Not in this episode.The ‘Army of the Dead’ are strangely kept back by a knee-high perimeter of dragonglass and, yes, dragonglass doesn’t agree with them, but it’s not like it’s not easily hurdle-able. Dudes will climbing the sheer outer walls of Winterfell PDQ - and even before that, Melisandre will rhubarb-rhubarb that dragonglass on fire, which when the fire runs out, it will literally take one dead dude to break through the ‘impenetrable’ barrier.It would not take an undead human pyramid for them to get past ten minutes ago. One dead dude giving another dead dude a leg up would have been enough.They have a Giant for goodness sake.This is not rocket science, no matter how much Davos waves his landing sticks as if it were.There is drama in the Crypts.Tyrion: If we were out there, I might see something that someone else is missing. Something that makes a difference.Good luck with that. Most of the episode has no lighting.Tyrion: Remember the Battle of the Blackwater. I brought us through the Mud Gate. I might make a difference.Sansa: There’s nothing you could do.Probably because there is no Mud Gate. And you wouldn’t be able to see.Tyrion; You might be surprised at the lengths I’d go to avoid joining the Army of the Dead. I can think of no organisation that’s suited to my talents … [drinks]Are there any pubs left?Sansa: It’s why we’re down here.Tyrion: Maybe we should have stayed married?Sansa: You were the best of them.Tyrion: What a terrifying thought,Sansa: It wouldn’t work between us.Tyrion: Why not?Sansa: The Dragon Queen. The divided loyalties would become a problem.Maybe Tyrion should become Sansa’s Hand? The last two episodes signposted this pretty blatantly, but, then again, the last two episodes seemingly have no bearing upon this one, so it’s well worth flogging that horse, yet again.There is drama in the Godswood.Theon: (with his bow) Bran, I just want you to know - I wish the things I did, everything you did, brought you to where you are now. Where you belong. Home.Bran: I’m going away now.wtfTheon: Go where?Dreamy-look Bran catapults Angry Birds - three ravens - in the Night King’s direction.If it were real history, he’s only gone and sent the world’s first Tweet.Cut to ‘Battle’.‘Army of the Dead’ ‘break through’ the knee-high dragonglass and scale the walls.Davos says ‘Man the walls!’.Well, OK, then Davos, let’s do that.Everybody is saving everybody else, but it’s hard to see because no lighting in this episode. I think Brienne saves Jaime who saves her back. Gendry doing some good battering of dead dudes. Arya is like the Rat Sensei out of ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ or the sword guy from Indiana Jones.Beric has his bloody fire sword.Arya decapitates some fools.I really didn’t expect Melisandre to show up until Beric had carked it. Wouldn’t have blamed her to be honest - she’d probably be religiously obliged to talk to him, and who the hell would voluntarily talk to Beric? He is so boring that nobody has ever asked him about his fire sword.The Hound has mistaken himself for Lurkfinger. He, and the backside of a vertical pillar, have been inseparable since the episode started. Beric presumes to chide him.Beric: Clegane, we need you. You can’t give up on us.The Hound: We’re fighting death. You can’t beat death.Beric: Tell her that.Whatever.The Hound is more scared of being stuck with Beric than of fire - and he is really scared of fire. Unfortunately, despite leaving his lurking spot, he is soon back-to-back bro-ing with Beric - though that doesn’t stop Beric yapping, not at all - but the good news is that Beric dies, and the Hound saves Arya, so everyone’s a winner in the end.Arya has some more shenanigans in dark corridors.There is running, crashing, panting and so on, but though we’ve had the words from the trailer last episode whilst holding a dagger and can add the legging it down a corridor, we still haven’t seen her drawing back a bow with a fire arrows loaded, so she can expect to find herself back down there again, at least once, before the Season is out.But first, it’s a chat with Melisandre, which kicks off with mutual agreement that each of them knows the other. No time for celebration though.Arya: You said we’d meet again.Melisandre: And here we are - at the end of the world.So much for her prophetic skills. She must have been the only person who didn’t get a shufty at the plot for this episode eighteen months ago. Which is weird because Volantis is only an ad break away in terms of travelling time.Arya: … as we know it … and I feel fine.Not really.Arya: You said I’d shut many eyes forever. You were right about that too.Melisandre: Brown eyes, green eyes and blue eyes.We’ll pretend they didn’t shame themselves with the Syrio Forel callback.Blue eyes, eh?Here they come. Steady lads. Make every shot count.Theon has the entire population of the Iron Islands with him in the Godswood. I count all six as present.Yara is ruling seaweed, I guess.Here they come. The Night King flying Viserion.Oo-err missus - the Night King’s got his Ice Spear out. Cheeky.Since no-one’s mentioned their cock this episode, he didn’t have a choice.Some Dragon-on-Dragon action - this is desperate stuff - and Jon is grounded. Davos can wave his landing lights all he likes.Dany gives the Night King the full ‘Dracarys’ treatment, like the Night King gives any kind of a shit about it. He strides through the dragonfire with his golf-bag strapped to his back.The Night King looks smug.Surely he’d have picked a stronger look for his first ever facial expression?He’s smiling.What the fuck is that? In case he hasn’t noticed, his army is a bag of crap, his White Walkers may as well be doing the worm and the only person of significance they’ve taken out is a 10 year old girl - and it took an actual Giant to do it.He has brought nothing, but shame upon whatever House he is.Well, alright, they just got Jorah.I thought Jorah was dead twice before he actually was and couldn’t work out why nobody was upset. Personally, I’m outraged: he, Lyanna and Edd - but not Beric - were worth more than dying in this … whatever it was.There’s also a weird moment where Jon is sheltering from Viserion’s blue raspberry sauce that does nothing, only to run out to grab a sword when he is already holding one.Jon then runs up to the Night King’s back, the Night King turns round, does a half-assed arm raise and there’s some flicking open of blue eyes, but not much of anything, and the Night King just walks off, like, the writers have got to Baelish me in the Godswood, so off I go.The GodswoodThe six Ironborn are defeated in more than 10 seconds, which has to worry the White Walker Hippy Patrol who walked in under the arch, as if filming their final video as an aging, desperate boyband before they split and pretend it’s due to ‘artistic differences,’Not content with wasting the lives of Edd, Jorah and Lyanna, but not Beric, we lose Theon too, but he went out as he would wanted at the completion of his redemption arc, which is some sort of comfort.The string arrangement playing in the background becomes somewhat jauntier. Really, anything could happen. I mean, the Night King’s going to lose, that’s been clear since Sam and his disingenuous lack of gloves, but, still, anything could happen. All the episodes before have meant nothing at all.It’s Arya.She runs up to the Night King and stabs a fool.Be in no doubt, Season Eight Episode Three Night King, is a fool.(not to detract from Arya’s achievement there: she’s a badass)The Night King disintegrates like a wet fart …… and it’s contagious.The White Walker Hippy Patrol, the ‘Army of the Dead’, and poor Viserion wet-fart their way out of existence too.Melisandre takes off her ruby necklace, drops in the snow like ‘fuck this’ - and she disintegrates too. I don’t blame her.I’m probably missing something here, but I thought the episode was just awful. There was a Battle at Winterfell, but it wasn’t for Winterfell.Here are the Starks, who have for millenia kept watch for ‘Winter is Coming’ - for generations, their home was where Winter when it came was meant to fall. It should have been meaningful, yet it didn’t feel like anything at all.Perhaps it will be meaningful going forward.Apart from Theon - ‘Theon, you’re a good man’ - with Bran, it felt … I don’t know, but it should have been something.Surely?However …Season Eight Episode Three Night King did not deserve a Benny Hill chase.Season Eight Episode Three Night King would have been shocked by the first pert blonde in a bikini, offered her a cardigan, then tripped over his own arse and died, before the newsagent had even rolled up his paper to pretend it was a truncheon.Season Eight Episode Three Night King deserves to go out to ‘You Just Haven’t Earned It Yet, Baby’ by The Smiths, but we deserve it, as sung by the great Kirsty MacColl.*Fridge Logic‘Half an hour after the show is over, a random viewer is staring into his refrigerator, vaguely bemused by the fact that his six-pack of beer has somehow become a two-pack of beer. Rather than work out how this might have happened, it occurs to him to wonder how in the hell Sydney Bristow went from Hungary to Melbourne, Australia, then to LA, all within 24 hours.It didn't bother him during the show. It wasn't until he discovered he was running short of beer that it became an issue.Fridge Logic has been the writer's-room term for these little Internal Consistency issues for a good while, as in "Don't sweat the Fridge Logic, we've got bigger fish to fry. We've only got 20 minutes left to work in three costume changes, a foreign language, and a weird wig." It refers to some illogical or implausible plot point that the audience doesn't realize during the show, but only long afterwards. This naming is highly subjective, since not every person follows the same train of thought. Some people will never even realise there was a problem, while others will call it a Plot Hole, since they already noticed the problem during the show’Fridge Logic - TV Tropes
s08e03	It’s really difficult for me to write a review the way it should be written. But I will try,First of all, I have two “personal” issues. You can skip these, if you want. a) Sky Austria streamed the US broadcast via Sky X… well, the streaming was interrupted at the moment of Jon’s charge on foot. Then it reprised but sound only. Then the episode was put up on demand… still no image. I had to resort to old Sky Ticket to watch the ending. Sky Austria is going to get my rage. b) Both in episode 2 and in this episode my friends agreed with me that the showrunners seemed to have copied parts of my fanfiction “The song of the bear who was a fool” written with the nickname Black-and-Pink Unicorn Guardian, written two years ago. Coincidence or they really copied it? Especially the Arya parts… who knows!*At some points, I think they nailed the atmosphere… fear, claustrophobia, useless strategies against supernatural powers… the music. Then they really ruined it all by making it all impossible to see. Too dark, too messy. Many disappointing things.The Dothraki being annihilated was on one hand a powerful scene, because it set the atmosphere. On the other hand, it screamed “the showrunners never even read a single book on warfare”. But… hey, most of us hated them. It reminded me of the useless charges of the Italians on the Isonzo against Austrian machine guns in World War One, anyway. Maybe that was what they were going for, who knows.The Dothraki being annihilated also makes Daenerys less powerful. I have the impression that even the Unsullied aren’t that many.Lyanna went down as a hero, and went down in a way that reminded in part her sister Dacey (you can read about her death in the books - she, too, tries to do something before getting killed).I am still convinced that Melisandre’s necklace, hitting the ground, resurrected Jorah. (Denial or genius? :-) ) Jorah died mouthing “I … love” (either that, or sleeping only 40 minutes last night hasn’t been a good idea). EDIT: I am not talking of when he hits the ground. When he hits the ground, he mouths “I am hurt”. Then he mouths something in Daenerys’s arms, and it really looks like “I love you”. Why wouldn’t it be those words?I also would like to remind this fandom that the most romantic scenes on the show were all between Jorah and Daenerys. Daenerys crying like that? Never seen. Drogon coming to mourn his father? Remember that, both in book-verse and show-verse, we only had the dragons because Jorah picked up Daenerys and brought her into that tent. Also, Jorah was the first man to see the dragons and to be seen by them. Powerful scene, and - incredibly - Emilia Clarke nailing it.Jon was… useless? I mean, even Daenerys did more. Daenerys stabbing zombies alongside Jorah was epic! Jon was… what was Jon, exactly?To be honest, I think letting Grey Worm, Jaime, and Brienne all survive is unrealistic. And I think there were other survivors as well. We will see.All in all, not bad, but it felt too… stretched out, sorry to say that. Two minutes of stares directed at Theon, and then again between the NK and Bran? Jon escaping yet another mass of zombies?And I still have to get over the fact that it really looks like D&D copied my fanfiction…I might write more and proofread after I have slept a little. Greetings from Austria, where it’s 6:15 am!*Line about Arya looking forward to seeing this face of death + some things from my battle schemes, albeit in a dumbed down version + Arya killing the NK with the dagger were published in this fic of mine. The Song of the Bear who was a Fool / https://www.fanfiction.net/s/126... . Coincidence?
s08e03	The night is dark and full of SPOILERSDon’t spend half an hour messing with the brightness settings on your TV — being able to see jack shit was intentional. I suppose it did contribute to the ambiance but I struggled to follow some parts.The dothraki mounting a suicidal charge was pretty dumb. It just gave the enemy many more units.A bit weird how Melisandre got a (reasonably) “happy ending” and no comeuppance for burning little girls alive.I predicted Edd and Beric kicking the bucket and was feeling pretty good about myself but Grey Worm beat the odds. Jorah got to die saving Dany so he probably jizzed in his pants with fulfillment.Why was Bran being guarded by Theon and his 10 mates away from everyone else? I feel sorry for Theon’s mates getting that job.RIP Theon. Definitely one of my top 3 male characters without a cock on the show.Bran was a real letdown. Didn’t contribute anything really. (I guess he knew what would happen, but I thought he’d have some kind of visual showdown with the Night King at least.)I feel like Jon and Dany half-assed it with the dragons a bit. Close quarters battle is more exciting for the audience though so that’s probably why more wights weren’t dragon fodder.Arya hiding from the wights was pretty tense. Good stuff.Is it bad that I always want Sam to get killed?The death of the Night King (and white walkers) seemed a bit anticlimactic but I guess that was the point. Probably misdirection ahead of the real finale, whatever that is.Is there going to be a happy ending only for Varys to screw things up for everyone at the end? I’m worried that he’s still alive and hasn’t done anything for so long.I just want Jaime to kill Cersei, and Cleganebowl. Please?
s08e03	I’m pretty thrilled honestly. It was a big fight, and Sapochnik captured a dark mood in a way that felt uniquely dark and dangerous without becoming oppressive and dull.Things I loved:The Catspaw dagger came full circle: a Stark saved Bran from it and a Stark saved Bran with it.Pretty sure I can count the season as a success now after Arya’s moment.Lyanna Mormont is a fucking legend, holy shit.Jorah Mormont went out on exactly the right note.The Mormont line ending makes me feel profoundly sad and proud, like I just witnessed a legend in the making over the course of the series with Jeor/Jorah/Lyanna.So much love for Theon.The Unsullied were the fucking bomb. I felt like they totally lived up to the hype about being the best infantry in the world.Really happy about Grey Worm, surprisingly. His storyline has felt like a labor lately, but this battle breathed new life into it.Things I’m scratching my head about:TNK reanimating corpses in the crypt seemed gratuitous and dumb to me. We know stuff about how corpses are treated by Silent Sisters that contradicts the idea that this could happen. Disappointed by this; surely there was a better way to raise the stakes for Sansa & Co.What was Bran doing during the whole battle? Was he warging somewhere? Why show him warging crows if he wasn’t able to do anything?Dolorous Edd went out on an unworthy line. I really expected a better quip for his last words.I’m really surprised the dragons both made it and Jon & Dany didn’t get into it.We’ll never know what the deal was with there being 13 Others?No explanation about the Night King’s history or relationship with the Starks/Three Eyed Raven. I don’t buy the idea that the Children of The Forest created The Others because it seems inconsistent with the books, so maybe this is for the best.
s08e06	Drogon flew away to escape from the bad writing.OrDrogon is looking for the writers right now. ( I hope for the latter)Like I don't understand what was the point of Jon's secret Targaryen arc?What was R+L=J for? Why was he ‘Aegon Targaryen’What was point of him finding out about this parents? What was the point of Sam and the so called ‘Three-eyed-Raven’ telling him he is *not* a bastard? Like why did Rhaegar run away with Lyanna? Why was he obsessed with the prophecy?What was this -Bran : ‘ I can't be the lord of anything’Tyrion : ‘So you wanna be king?’Bran: ‘Why do you think I am here?’What is the point of a Night's Watch now? It is a fanciful jail for bastards and criminals? Why was Jon exiled there?So since Bran knows all the stories; he should be king?? Like what purpose did he serve as The Three Eyed Raven?If GoT writers wanted to break the wheel, why have a King or Queen at all? Why have a realm of the 6/7 kingdoms? Why does the North deserve special status?Why doesn't the story end with NO Kings or Queen! Just a council or let all kingdoms run themselves?And for crying out loud : FORESHADOWING IS NOT THE SAME AS CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, OMFG.I can't lie, I liked Danny and was hoping for a better ending for her. But her ending did leave a bad taste in the mouth. But I would've even taken a well developed character arc for her turning dark. They try to introduce dialogue between Tyrion and Jon which was more for the audience to understand why Danny deserved to be off.Even if GRRM tells the writers that she goes crazy and decimates KL’s. The problem lies with how the writers got her there. They knew they had to get her from point A - B, but instead of taking a route which made thoughtful and logical sense they took a route which was rushed and lazy. Therefore it gives us an end for her which is cheap and unearned. We get to go on a journey with these characters, we see good turn evil and vice versa. Which is what made the show so beautiful!Endless pursuit of power is dark, and Danny turn to darkness could've worked in the right story writing but this did not work because the progression was completely butchered.GMMR has himself said that he goes and reads discussions on website to see what fans are guessing. And he does admit some people got it right.. BUT despite that he doesn't go about changing storylines or plotlines. Because he laid in clues which lead to something and the new solution won't be satisfactory. So he does not change it. Cause that would be cheating, it would ruin the series.So in conclusion, D&D have given the audience cheap and unearned “plot twists” which for some reason people are happy about (???).DD: ‘ We hoped to avoid the expected, since Jon has always been the hero of the series, and the savior but it did not seem right to us for this moment’WTFSo setting up Arya as the kiler of NK: CHEAP AND UNEARNED but we wanted to do a plot twist nobody saw coming. So yeah.In another interview GRRM himself quoted : ‘ Ofcourse you have an emotional reaction. I mean would I prefer they do it exactly the way I did it? Sure. it can also be traumatic. Because their creative vision and yours doesn't match, and you get creative differences - that leads to a lot of conflict.’ ‘You totally extraneous things like the studio or the network weighing in, and they have some particular thing that has nothing to do with story but relates to - Well this character has very high Q ratings so lets give her/him her a more stuff to do. The series has not been completely faithful.’This is frankly a more acceptable ending :Lastly for all those people who think that anyone who disagrees with the storytelling of the S8 is ‘entitled’, ‘whiney’ and ‘wasn't paying attention’ or ‘STFU and don't watch it’. Studios makes TONS OF money off your back, our back. These writers have made ton and tons of money, because all of us enable them to. We as fans deserve respect because we are the reason they are where they are. If you liked the season good for you but doesn't give you the right to trash those who don't. It should be criticized, and if it not good enough for some, don't tell the others to shut up and accept it. The online petition to redo S8, which has support from more than a million people itself states they are not expecting an actual redo. I quote the person who started the petition :I don’t think people can reasonably expect HBO to completely remake the season, or any part of this particular series (keep in mind the prequel spinoffs). It costs a fortune to shoot one episode, and I think most signers understand that. Will HBO lose gobs of money over this? Eh probably not. As Heath Ledger’s Joker once said, “It’s not about the money, it’s about sending a message.” And I think this message is one of frustration and disappointment at its core.Is Dany going to succumb to madness in the books? Probably. Is Arya going to kill the Night King? Well he doesn’t exist in the books as of yet so…maybe? Is Jaime going to sacrifice his entire character arc to go embrace Cersei? I’d doubt it, but that’s GRRM’s decision. The issue I have is not necessarily with what we got, it’s HOW we got there -- A rushed, laughably inconsistent mess of a season fraught with cringe-inducing, arc-slaying dialogue and “everybody is stupid” syndrome. We can expect that the books will describe a more sensical path toward the ultimate conclusions that we will see on Sunday.You don’t need to be a mechanic to know your car is broken.Adding something in to make you smile.Valar Morghulis
s07e07	I will divide the review in to 3 sections, mixed in with a bit of recap and my opinions.King’s LandingKing’s Landing is surrounded by Dany’s armies. Something that should have happened in episode 2. The Unsullied take a reasonable amount of time to make it across Westeros and this is how travel times are supposed to be managed on the show. In contrast, we got travel times of ridiculously short lengths last week.Bronn and Jaime have an interesting conversation about wars and cocks. I won’t disagree with Bronn. All that coin and no cock. I guess the Unsullied purchase a lot of cheesecake. Hot Pie’s business must be booming.Interestingly, Cersie’s queen’s-guard have changed uniform and sigils. They are no longer ‘white cloaks’. They wear black head to toe. A very generic touch by the show-writers to portray Cersei as evil and tinkering with GRRM’s inversion of common fantasy tropes. The group is headed by the mountain and the rest of the members are unknown. They have a sigil on their breastplates that I can not recognize or relate to any faction within GoT (comment if you can shed light on this).Dany’s queen’sguard is a bunch of rapey, stinking Dothrakis.The trip to Dragonpit includes plenty of filler conversation. Missandei gets paid for doing absolutely nothing on the show, so she is brought on to question what the Dragonpit was built for, and Jorah gives the viewers a mini history lesson. I enjoyed the interaction between Brienne and the Hound. I glimpsed a shadow of a smile on the Hound’s face after he learns about Arya and her success as a warrior. I would actually enjoy a love triangle between Brienne, Tormund and the Hound. It would be far more interesting than the other love stories we have in this season.The Hound gives the Mountain a fair warning. It is not clear if the Mountain really cares or understands it, but this is an obvious indication that Cleganebowl will definitely happen in season 8.Dany makes a grand entrance that was expected. However, by displaying her power and might, she displayed her vulnerability as well. She brings along two dragons and Cersei is clever enough to spot Viserion missing.Euron’s call for Theon to submit had me in a giggle fit. It is very irrelevant and Theon has nothing to submit. It just goes to show that the viewers should sit back, and enjoy this ‘Second Hand Jack Sparrow’ and his silly little lines.Then, we have Tyrion giving a presentation which is followed by he and Jon selling anti-Wight products.Infomercial:Tyrion: Do you have a Wight problem in your castle? Do you always get those nasty blue eyed dead men creep up on you and tear your siblings apart? Well, we are here to tell you of the new products that are revolutionizing the anti-Wight industry. Here to help me demonstrate is my not-so-tall friend, the King in the North, Jon Snow.Jon: *fake salesman laugh*, Ohh Tyrion, you are one to talk. But he is right, folks of KL, I am here to show you the perfect technique to eliminate your Wight problem. And no, it is not showing them Tyrion’s noseless face. *fake salesman laugh*Tyrion: *laughing gaily*Jon: Here it is folks. You will not believe your eyes. We have the new ‘au naturale’ line of products that will rid you of your Wight problem, once and for all.Tyrion: *echoing sentiments* Once and for all.Jon: Folks, remember, this is a special deal, and we are only doing it in your capital city. We have performed demonstrations before in Dragonstone and the North. All our customers have been 100 percent satisfied. If you die using our products on a Wight, we will refund your kin your golden dragons and give them a Targaryen cloak. To match the cloak of Daenerys Stormborn, Queen of……….The Hound: Fucking get on with it you midget cunts!!Tyrion: Oh such fire in your voice my burnt man.Jon: No need to wake the dog, Tyrion. Now would you bring the test-Wight, my burnt man.Jon: Here you have it folks. We are so certain our product works that we will perform a live demonstration.Tyrion: My bastard friend is right. You will no longer have to purchase second rate products from the Stormlands. Because our products are superior.Jon: That is right folks. You can’t purchase second rate products as the Stormland don’t exist on our show anymore.Tyrion:Jon: Err…I mean observe!!!Tyrion: Our products work, 60% of the time, EVERY TIME!!Jon: Folks, you have seen it for yourselves. Now try it for yourselves!! We have a limited offer that we are giving to our first 25 queens. So get in early and save. What is the low low low price of this unbelievable offer, Tyrion?Tyrion: Now listen up the good queen of King’s Landing. This is a limited offer which will never be repeated. And I mean NEVER!Jon: *echoing sentiments* Never!!Tyrion: The low low price of this offer is a truce. No war till we take care of the army of the dead.*End of infomercial*Qyburn is quite interested in the Wight arm. I am sure he wants to perform some sort of experiments on it so he can fine-tune his next line of Un-Gregors.Cersei asks Jon not to take up arms against the Lannisters or take sides in the war. Which is fair. This is where Jon’s stupidity shows. Not because he told the truth. But because he ‘bent the knee’. Dany had already seen the army of the dead, she could not unsee it and she was bound to help defeat the NK. Cersei and Dany would wage war on each other while the north stays out of the war until there is an eventual winner. Then a deal, truce or submission could have been discussed. Cersei rightfully feels played. I am not sure if Davos was aware of Jon bending to knee to Dany, or not. His reaction was strange. He seemed as if he had heard the news for the first time.Cersei retreats to her chambers with Tyrion following her. Tyrion’s talent is his mouth. He aims to please her using his mouth and get a deal done. Dany pulls out the dead-child/dragon card which is not Jon’s fault. Another subtle hint that she desires real children to replace her dead dragon. Jon better get some protein bars and get ready.Lena does an amazing job in this episode. With mediocre dialogue and plot, Lena truly puts all her talents into salvaging the episode. Tyrion plays the victim card and Cersei does not buy it. Both the characters are in the right. Tyrion’s murder of Tywin left the Lannister family open to attack from all sources. Ellaria would not have dared poison Myrcella with Tywin alive, and the faith could not have controlled Tommen. However, Tyrion could not just let Tywin get away with his hatred of Tyrion and his hypocrisy. The ending of their conversation is cut and we do not see it. It would be interesting to find out what went on in that room. This could be the issue on Tyrion’s mind later in the episode.Cersei calls her banners, or so it seems on the surface. Varys has a big smile on his face. That is what his role has been reduced to in this season.More references are made to Jon and Dany getting together. Dany comments on how she is the last of her family and Jon consoles her by suggesting the witch may have been blowing hot air about her infertility. Stay tuned for Jon testing out Dany’s fertility later in the episode.One aspect the show got right was Dany’s reference to her family’s source of power being the dragons. This should be taken at face value by the audience who assume Dany is some sort of demi-god or all powerful magical being. Without dragons who were given to her as eggs, she would be either part of the Dosh Khaleen or a pile of ashes in Drogo’s pyre.Jaime has obviously been seduced by Jon and Tyrion’s sales pitch and is planning the transport of their armies to the north. Cersei interrupts him and informs him of her real plans to which Jaime does not react well. A reference to Jon is made as “the Stark boy”, which is in STARK contrast to him always labelled as the “bastard” by Cersei. They are pushing the Stark reference more obviously until he is unveiled as a Targaryen.I like Cersei’s planning and the brokering of a deal with the Golden Company. Euron’s departure makes more sense now and he still seems to be with Cersei, where many people thought he would switch allegiance to Dany in favor of her dragons. However, the part I dislike is the manner in which Jaime abandons Cersei. This was a long time coming. It happened at the end of AFFC, but the show dragged it on. I would have much preferred it if Jaime abandoned Cersei at the end of last season, where he shows up and watches Cersei being crowned and half the city destroyed. That was the perfect moment to leave behind the mad-queen. I am also very disappointed that this is the reason Jaime abadones Cersei. Specially, when she is carrying his child. Jaime never played the father to his other children, but he was always in the delivery room and always by Cersei’s side. Jaime abandones Cersei due to her lies, deceit, manipulation and infidelity in the books. The infidelity did not make it big on the show, or at all. Jaime’s life revolved around Cersei and his love for her. It is a monumental occasion when he breaks free of her false love and tries to correct the wrong of his ways. In any case, finally, Jaime abandons Cersei and she is left with the crazy folk, Euron, Qyburn and the Mountain.Jaime’s departure coincides with snow falling on KL. It is a sad moment. Jaime often feels remorse about failing to protect Rhaegar’s children in the books. He is haunted by dreams of it. He is finally headed to protect and assist Rhaegar’s child, Jon. He is no longer dressed in Lannister gear. He is his own man. He has Widow’s Wail with him. The two swords made from Ice will be reunited back in Winterfell in season 8. I expect Bronn to follow Jaime. His little conversation with Tyrion perhaps put the thought in his head. Cersei will do Bronn no favors and they hate each other. Both on and off the show. Lena and Jerome have a deal not to shoot scenes together. I am sure that Bronn will follow Jaime north. Darkness ascends on KL and it is a sign that the last good thing (Jaime) has left KL. I am quite worried for Jaime. He will be in the north where the fan favorites are. He may be pushed behind the scenes as Tyrion and Varys have been. When was the last time Varys did or said anything of importance? His death has to come next and it may be as ridiculous as LF’s.WinterfellDue to lack of quality writing and plot points in the absence of popular characters, the north has been reduced to this little cat and mouse game between Sansa and LF. By all rights, LF should have died much earlier, or his character should not have been butchered. He is much better than to lurk in the corners and made the butt of every jape. Sansa carefully sets up Baelish and the show has finally made an attempt to portray Sansa learning deceit and manipulation from LF. A few seasons too late. LF does make a good point though. A recurrent theme within the season is that Jon and Dany are both young and unmarried. If you have not figured out by now, these two are hinted subtly to end up together.Sansa indirectly discusses Baelish’s crimes with him. How he rose to power in the Vale by killing Lysa to become the Lord Protector. She makes it seem as though she is discussing Arya. This part is well set up. Arya is brought to the audience chamber and Baelish is addressed for his crimes. He is initially shocked and denies the crimes, but here is Bran. Acting like maester Aemon. I am not sure if it is a deliberate ploy, but Bran looks blind, often. Even when he not Warging anything. Just as maester Aemon did. Bran mentions the manner which Baelish betrayed Ned. Baelish immediately starts to beg and falls to his knees. This is badly done! There is no reason Baelish should accept his crimes. There is no proof for him betraying Ned. No one else can see what Bran sees. It is a bit over the top for everyone to accept that Baelish betrayed Ned. His murder of Lysa was technically done to save Sansa as Lysa was looking to drag Sansa through the moon door. But, the show is looking to close character plots and move on to Dany and Jon. A better move would have been to have the Hound stop in Winterfell on the way to the Wall where he provides evidence of Baelish’s betrayal of Ned as he is one of the few persons alive who was present in the throne room on that day. This is not a fair trial, it is an accusation, judgement and sentencing all in one go. I doubt Baelish would ever fall to his knees begging in the books. If he dies, he would die still lying through his teeth and would never admit his role in the chaos. Arya cuts his throat and Baelish is finally put out of his misery. This is not the northern way. Ned and Robb executed their men in front of the heart tree. It was a nice piece of irony to have Baelish killed by his own dagger. I assume many viewers applauded Baelish’s death, but I didn’t. I knew his death would come at some point, but a character with his complexity and aura needed a different death. A complex plot revealing his crimes and then a sacrifice at the base of the heart tree to conjure up some well needed magic. Perhaps, fodder for Bran’s power. Finally, the northern dilemma and mediocre plot with LF ends. It is unclear when the two sisters began to plot this, and when Bran got involved. But let’s not mind that. Because it is GoT and who cares about logic anymore. The sisters make up and mention Ned, which is a nice moment portraying the legacy the great man left behind. I wonder if the lords know of Jon bending the knee. Or if even Arya knows! How would they react? Stay tuned for season 8, where real issues in the plot will not be addressed. But I promise, you will get more Dany and Jon kissing in the rain.Samwell Tarly finally arrives in Winterfell. He immediately goes to see Bran where he goes along with Bran being the 3ER. Apparently, everyone believes him now. Bran is in front of a fire and suspiciously looks like he is staring at it when he sees visions. Does he get visions from the fire, too? Will this be important in the next season?After refusing to tell his own sisters, Bran tells Sam that Jon is the son of Rhaegar. And a Sand! Oh, c’mon D&D. You guys are an absolute joke. Bastards are not given surnames for their location of birth, Their surname is for whichever parent or kin that claims them. Jon is still a Snow for Ned claimed him. If Rhaegar had claimed him, he would be Waters. Apparently Sam remembers Prince Ragger and his indifference towards that passage read by Gilly. He remembers every part of that passage and gives Bran the brilliant idea Bran hadn’t thought of himself yet, to look for their wedding in a vision. He sees their wedding and declares that Robert’s rebellion was based on a lie. Which is wrong. Robert’s rebellion was based on truth, they rebelled for their lives and Aerys caused it. Rhaegar played a part. But the rebellion was not based on a lie. They are playing the love angle between Rhaegar and Lyanna, rather than the prophecy angel which would make better sense. As it stands, Rhaegar and Lyanna were absolute cunts who plunged the realm into war and death for their love. Parallels between R&L and Jon & Dany are made during Bran’s narration. They are making it seem as if Jon and Dany had to come together, for love. And they might leave behind a child, just as R&L did. *barf*. I don’t know why I still expect quality writing from this show.DragonstoneJon is the war commander now. Tyrion has been demoted. Jon suggests that it would take the Dothraki two weeks to make it to Winterfell along the King’sroad, which is more realistic than the ridiculous time-warps we got last week. They discuss of a one well placed arrow to end Dany. I wonder if this is foreshadowing for an attempt on Dany’s life.The conversation between Theon and Jon was another reference to Jon having to deal with two identities. Targaryen and Stark. He tells Theon that he can be both Stark and Greyjoy, which indicates that Jon will not choose between the two identities. While Rhaegar will be a part of him, he may always remain a Stark.Jon then goes to Dany’s room, the red door. Dany finally has a red door that she always dreamt of. They proceed to test out Dany’s fertility while Bran narrates Jon being the heir to the throne. I wonder if Bran heard Lyanna’s whisper in season 6, and if he did, why does he still think Jon to be a Sand, for Lyanna called him Aegon Targaryen, indicating his legitimacy. I was hoping for Aemon, but his name is Aegon. I still hold out hope that his name could be Aemon in the books. There a few hints for his name being Aemon.Tyrion watches the two have sex and retreats with a suspect look on his face. Some have interpreted this to be jealousy due to his love for Dany. I think this is political worry. Tyrion has plans that do not include Jon and Dany together. Perhaps, he wants to be rid of monarchy and select an heir and does not want Jon and Dany to have a child. Or, it could have something to do with the ending of his conversation with Cersei. I hope they do not ignore and forget that aspect.EastwatchThe Wall comes down through Nazgul on a flapping dragon that looked like the NK was on a sea-saw. The dragon-fire was practically the NK welding against the Wall. The Wall comes down and the White Walkers make it past. Ideally, they should make it to Winterfell before Jon and Dany seeing as it is a short distance to the Wall. I am sure Tormund and Beric are still alive. They will climb out from under the rabble next season.I do not hold too much hope for season 8. They have managed to make the White walkers a side show to the throne. Dany and Jon will save the world and kill the NK before Jon perishes in the war. Dany goes to KL to destroy Cersei. Dany will then die giving birth to their child. The child would be ‘ice & fire’, well more fire than ice and he will be the heir. Rings of awful twilight scripts. I hope for some conflict between Tyrion and Dany, Varys should have a part in it. Jaime should have a big role and not be pushed into the background. But I am not holding my breath for much logic. There are too many redundant character who should have died in this season to make room for a non-rushed plot next season. Missandei, Davos, Podrik, Brienne, Sansa, Beric, Gilly, Theon, Yara and many more should have died in a big battle or disaster in this last episode. I am not sure what Missandei gets paid for, to be honest.As things stand now, I am supporting the NK, Euron, Cersei and the Golden Company. Cersei can’t be made a redundant character as she is the main villain. Lena is an excellent actor who still commands respect and is holding the episodes together. I fear greatly for Nikolaj and his role next season. I don’t think we will get a bittersweet ending in the show as promised by GRRM. Dany or Jon’s death at the moment will not sadden me. It will not be bittersweet. It will actually be a good thing. Their child left behind will make it a fairy tale.It is about time I conclude this post. Here is Jaime Lannister for those who appreciate the books.
s07e07	Overall…kind of shit. There was one huge flaw this season that really bugged me: fan-service.One of the great things about this series (books and show) was that the writers didn't really give a shit what you wanted.Characters rose and fell based on their own merits, not on any kind of audience interference. It was unpredictable (unless you were Littlefinger), and highly engaging.This season finale and season, were a huge , painful exception.Call me a masochist - but I want to be blindsided. I want important characters to die for their missteps.But instead, fans got their wish list checked off:Incestuous sex with Dany and Jon. Check.Jamie leaving Cersei. Check.Theon redeeming himself. Check.Sansa outmanipulating Littlefinger. Check.All the living Starks reunited. Check.Arya enacting her revenge/mass murder. Check.Small and sweet reunions between frenemies (Bron, Tyrion, Podrick, etc.) Check.Jon surviving another near death experience inexplicably. Check.Dany basically beating the crap out of Lannisters. Check.Ugh…I could go on.Not to mention the subtle as an undead ice-dragon hints they kept dropping.Dany: I CAN’T HAVE BABIES!You sure about that?Jon: I wasn't looking at her longingly.Sure.One dragon dies.Good thing there are only 2 remaining Targareyns.Bran: I'm the three eyed raven. I need to train more. I can see the past and the present.You said 3 eyes, right? Maybe you're forgetting the FUTURE!Nothing to do now but wait and hope that the show can get back on track for the final season.EDIT: Bas Leijser added some additional fan-service notes in the comments which were too good not to share:Foreshadowing of Cleganebowl. Check.Tormund (a fan favorite) survives. Check.Main characters survive while a bunch of redshirts die (when the Wall collapses). Check.Night King rides wight dragon (instead of just controlling it). Check.Night King takes down Wall with his present from Daenerys. Check.Continued dick jokes with Podrick. Check.Continued eunuch jokes. Check.Rhaegar and Lyanna’s marriage turned into a sappy love story. Check.
s07e07	Disclaimer-This is not a funny review.The reviewer tries to observe and report each sequence,story progression and character nuances to the best of his ability.And he takes his Game of Thrones very seriously.This is how the episode unfolded:-1.Dany showboats her armies. This episode began with montage of assembling troops, and ended with marching troops. A final call to the arms in a way. Well, in the opening sequence, Bronn and Jaime pities the ‘cockless’ Unsullied, perhaps because they had been able to cuckold and trap them in Casterly rock. But soon, the Dothraki march up and remind them of their own miserable fate at the Loot Train battle.2.Tyrion tells Jon Snow a million or more live at King’s Landing.Tells him there’s more job opportunities and far more brothels. That’s why you liked living there, Tyrion! Stop projecting. Meanwhile, the Hound gives the lonely wight some company.3.Cersei gives instructions to the Hound. Jaime starts frowning at her orders pretty early in this episode. This season, the show prepares us for everything.4.The delegates arrive. Brienne is already here, and sees the Hound is alive.Tyrion, Podrick and Bronn reuinte. Tyrion and Bronn trade insults but then cuts the BS and admit they are glad to see each other .Everyone gets to meet everyone. Bronn leaves with Podrick. Because A. The drink might make Pod spill the beans about Team Dany & Jon, while Bronn gets to gauge if he has a better chance of getting a castle if he sides with them. B. He wants to change teams, but more because of the dragons and the Dothraki. Sadly he didn’t get to see the undead to realize that the other side isn’t necessarily greener. C. He didn’t want to remain in the line of sight of Cersei, whom he had vexed by luring away Jaime to meet Tyrion. If the meeting went south, Cersei might remember to harm Bronn along with the visitors.5. Dany brings two dragons and shows all her cards. Does a mistake in my opinion. Cersei deduces that dragons are vulnerable after all, even if not to Qyburn’s ‘scorpion’ ballista. Later, she makes Jon reveal his allegiance(simply by invoking Ned Stark’s name) and gets to know Jon is siding with Dany. Something that was unclear to most till this point. Cersei thus gets her hand on important information throughout this meeting.6.Tyrion starts the talking,like he always does. Jon joins in.While the Hound demonstrates the wight, Jon tells them fire and dragonglass can kill the wights, but doesn’t mention Valyrian steel.7.Euron makes a scene of deserting. As planned with Cersei. Maybe Cersei is reading Sun Tzu. “Appear weak when you are strong”. And Euron doesn't want to be under careful vigilance of Team Dany as he goes to Essos for Golden Company.8.Jon makes an endearing little speech again and declares fealty to Dany. Cersei, maybe inspired by Jon, tells her actual plan. She will wait out the war while her enemies struggle to contain the paranormal threat.9.Jaimie is now treading jokes with Tyrion and even seems to worry for him as he enters Cersei’s chambers.10. Tyrion is no fool. He baits Cersei to kill him, knowing fully well Cersei can’t afford to do that with two dragons at her doorstep. He also realizes Cersei is with a child. Did he just kill this one too, by giving her wine? Unknowingly, maybe?..11. Dany and Jon discuss her fertility in enemy territory. So absurd.And talks about ‘getting fucked’. Get on with it, then! We are also given a hint that Mirri Maz Dur's prophecy may just be a spiteful lie. And the show might ignore it in S8 .12.Cersei finally tells the delegation she will send her army North to fight the undead. Ofcourse, what she doesn’t tell is that she will send her army, but only to take the Northern lands. Very clever, and yet so foolish to be so cocky in a show like this. Perfect laid plans are blown to smithereens in a matter of episodes here. Just ask Tyrion.13. It’s desolate in Winterfell. In the gloom, LF tells Sansa his playbook and tries to incite her against Arya. But as we will soon find out, he forgets to play by it himself. And doesn’t account for Bran and his special powers. Rookie move, Baelish.14.We see Jon giving the plans for troop movement in Dragonstone, and not Tyrion. Finally, eugenics has been implemented. Dany takes Jon's advice over Jorah's and that seems more symbolic than tactical. Jorah looks like he will have an aneurysm,does he realise what's going to happen when the two sail together?Theon notices Jon is the one calling the shots and asks his permission to leave. He needs to save Yara. Tells him all his mistakes happened because he was always torn between being a Greyjoy and a Stark. Jon forgives him from his side and tells him that he’s both Greyjoy and a Stark. Maybe this is a foreshadowing for Jon's own future grappling with dual citizenship.15. In a reversal of the scene at Winterfell, Theon actually prevails upon his men this time. He gets into a fight, which is seemingly the Ironborne way of deciding everything. Theon’s opponent goes for his nuts without realising Ramsay had already taken care of that. We are reminded that the writers get a year to write just seven episodes. Ample time to pull in punches and use crafty tropes.16.Northerners all assemble at Winterfell’s great hall. LF has orchestrated this to be Arya’s reckoning, but realizes late that it’s his own funeral. He has been played. Sansa never misses a foot here. She carefully alienates the Knights of the Vale first. By telling them LF killed Lady Lhysa and plotted to kill Lord Arryn. She also has ensured that the headstrong Lyanna Mormont is not there, so that LF can’t do shit by bringing up her infamous letter. Tyrion’s name is redeemed yet again from another crime he didn’t commit. Arya slits LF’s throat, and we see the dagger truly avenging Ned Stark’s death. It’s coming for you, Cersei!17.Jaime is instructing the bannermen. This is Season 7, episode 7. So ofcourse, there are only 7 bannermen pledging to House Lannister. Cersei later talks to Jaime privately and calls him the ‘stupidest Lannister’. She tells him about her scheme, about the Golden Company and their elephants and 20,000 men.The Iron bank’s support. But with all that new information, Jaime now turns against Cersei. Because A. His moral code found a voice for itself after that talk of honor by Jon Snow. B. Brienne did her bit by telling him to fuck loyalty and to just chose the ‘living’. C. He has given a word to join the fight up North, and he doesn’t break vows. D.The dying testimony of the wise Olenna must have been on the back of his mind. E. Cersei gloats about no one walks away from here.And the show doesn't take kindly to that kind of sentiment. Just ask Dany how she feels about her indestructible dragons. Poor Cersei, for all your clever manipulations, you might be the ‘stupidest Lannister’ yet. Tyrion probably plotted all of this to drive a wedge between you and Jaime. And it worked! Cersei thinks Tyrion killing Tywin left the Lannisters exposed,but hardly realises that Tyrion taking away Jaime exposes Cersei to danger more than anything else. It also opens up the possibility of an amorous relationship between Cersei and Euron in S8 .Maybe Cersei let's go of Jaime because she has a baby now and can form a dynasty on her own.Jaime leaves, and KL has no one worth saving anymore.(Commoners don't count in GoT. They are 'sheep'.)18. In a beautiful portray of scenery, Jaime crosses the greenery of South for the snow capped North, where a war will be waged. Cersei gave the correct assessment when she said he was always the one to run after adventures. The next scene, snow falls in KL for the first time. Its pouring down in the hallway with the maps. Winter has reached King’s Landing.19.Bran will tell anyone who’d care to listen that he’s the three eyed raven now. It’s no different when he meets Sam. Together they unearth Jon’s secret origin. He’s the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, who were officially wed by the High Septon. Rhaegar’s previous marriage was annulled. Roberts’ rebellion was based on a lie afterall. (The Barratheon claim to the throne is dissolved).Bran tells Sam he can see the past and the present(but not the future?yet he is the three eyed Raven ,no less) He is man of his words as well and puts his money where his mouth is. So he starts watching both the past and the present, together. And we get to see with him. While Bran talks about his aunt, Lyanna Stark,Jon is seen approaching his aunt, Daenerys Targaryen. When Bran tells about the love between his aunt and the Targaryen prince, Jon is seen making love to his aunt, who’s also a Targaryen royalty. Clever wordplay and imagery all around. Both have been nude on the show before. And yet the scene was brief,perhaps because the makers wanted to spare us more screentime of gory incest.And I feel for the actor who player Rhaegar Targaryen. He got like 2 seconds of fame,literally. The two get married under s three only with the high Septon in presence,no doubt to explain why no word got out.There’s one other witness to this unintentional transgression. Tyrion Lannister. And maybe Tyrion realizes that Dany may now find a heir of her own. Does it bother him that this circumvents his chances of becoming the Queen’s successor? Or was it simply jealousy,because Jon is now Dany's most trusted advisor?I hope Tyrion isn't lusting after his queen.He could still turn up to be a Targaryen. There's only so much of incest that we can take.20. The sisters are bonding after LF’s death and Bran probably has cleared the air between the two by his ‘insights’, offscreen. Arya now knows about Sansa's hardships and says she wouldn't have survived those. She owns this scene too. Love or hostility, Arya seems more endearing than her elder sister. This sequence has all the candour of a similar scene from last year. Between Jon and Sansa, catching up at the same spot in Winterfell.( “A raven came to Winterfell..white raven! Winter is here.” “Well, father always promised didn’t he?”) Another carefully crafted callback.21.Bran wargs into ravens again and observes Eastwatch. Beric and Tormund witness the undead invasion. The NK mounts undead Viserion and burns down a large segment of the wall. Viserion doesn't need to be politely asked (dracarys) to do a flamethrower .In one of the scenes, we are shown the edge of the wall for the first time. To instill the idea that,What has a beginning has an end. The last sequence from the previous season showed Dany’s armada setting sail for Westeros, with dragons. This season’s last scene shows NK’s countless footsoldiers and a few giants marching past the wall, spearheaded by a dragon.Now, The Easter eggWhere are these jolly band of undead heading to?Look closely at the top left part of the congregation . The Stark emblem.No,not for Jon.He’s not a Stark, remember?They want the three eyed Raven.
s07e07	SPOILERSThey didn't even bother to explain how the Unsullied got out of CR and to KL. Did Euron just backed off and the Unsullied swam their way to KL? Who rescued them, Dany or Dothraki or they themselves? They are still standing to 8000. Aren't many of them already dead – in Mereen, and then in CR, no?It was all for nothing if the Unsullied were to be brought on a whim. I really thought GreyWorm would be dead and if that happened, which could have only happened at the hands of Euron, Daenerys would go berserk and do some impulsive Mad Queen sort of things.Nice chatting between Bronn and Jaime. Which castle did he get, by the way, now that he is a lord?What the hell? That place doesn't look like KL. They shot it at Highgarden's location. The Dothraki entrance seen seems to have been taken from Daenerys’ train loot attack Dothraki’s entrance seen.How many ships does Daenerys actually have? (Smack that, I am asking this as a question now?)Jon, Jorah, Davos, Tyrion, Missandei are shown on a ship to KL. Where is Gendry? Missandei is wearing the shoulder cape like Dany.That “thing” has crossed the magic Wall. The Hound keeps checking on him.Nice little bantering between Tyrion, Podrick and Bronn. And everyone else.There's a meme, which is more of a fact going on around the Internet: “Arya Stark is not in danger; she is the danger”. That was also Brienne’s statement regarding her to Sandor.Dragonpit's depiction was incorrect. It's supposed to be much larger than that. Drogon could barely flap its wings there, not even move or go around in it. The structure is smaller than its book counterpart.I am surprised Cersei didn't comment about Sandor's allegiance to her enemy. She would have not knowing that he's not really allied to anyone.Cersei was the only one in the party who behaved as though the flamethrower beast didn't surprise her. She sat still on her chair.Show Euron being show Euron. And Theon is killing it.That thing's demonstration was as if they were doing a magic show. Cersei was terrified if it. Rejects the truce.Jon's every bit of Ned Stark's son. Even if he's biologically R+L, he's Ned's son, no matter what. This is also proved while he and Theon talk when they reach Dragonstone (point 22).Seems like this for the first time since Tyrion was born that he and Cersei have talked about their thoughts and feelings? Actually, properly talked to each other.Dany accepts that she is nothing without her dragons. That realization might have come from losing Viserion.“And your family hasn't seen it's end”. Plus that the witch who murdered her husband might not have been a reliable source of information. What else, this just points towards one fact: Dany is fit to have children and she will get pregnant in the future (point 31).Tyrion does what he's good at. Outtalking people and gets Cersei to agree on the truce.Sansa is taking her lessons all that very well. She is the best person to know that Arya is not the sort of person to vouch for titles and castles. She has no interest whatsoever in becoming the Lady of Winterfell. LF thought everyone is going against each other. Everyone wants to be a lord or lady and that is his mistake.“We will sail together” - Daenerys. Aye, aye. A lit of people have already shipped you together. Is it just me or everyone else who's reading Jon and Dany's words and their conversations as romantic chats or whatever you call it?Finally, they gave Theon a story. He struggles between Stark and Greyjoy. He's both. He's finally been forgiven. Theon fans have been waiting for this since long. Up until now no one has wanted him around themselves, except Yara and Sansa. Yara more than anyone.He has a mission now. Alfie Allen takes the cookie. He's stronger than ever. Yara rescue mission on way. I am happy that they didn't lay waste to his character. In the last season, there was no development, which was disappointing but this episode had. Maybe they saved the best for the last.Like I said before, Bran is the Legislature, Sansa is the Judiciary and Arya is the Executive. LF has a tough hide. If it were in the books he wouldn't have died like that. He's smart to read people and sense what people want. Albeit, he will die similarly in the books but with a stronger story line.Arya's good at killing. I watched and re-watched her slashing LF's throat in a slash many a times. The way she pulled it off amazing – both Arya and Maisie Williams.Cersei is invulnerable. I so much love that hateful character.Jaime has left Cersei's side. He is coming to realise what he ought to have realized earlier. I like it. Like Theon, they are giving his story line a proper arc as well.Winter has reached KL and the South. The slow GoT theme takes the cookie now. It will be poetic to see him aid Jon, Rhaegar's son in the Great War. Jaime has dreams of not being able to protect Elia, Aegon and Rhaenys. This would deem poetic when he helps Jon in the Great War. And, oh, Jaime’s cloak is black from white.But another fact, how will the volanqar theory come to reality if he is up North all the time. Since the prophecy has to come true, I imagine the twins will meet again.Bran being the generation's emo goth kid. Does not respond with words, instead shows Samwell the letter he got from Jon.As is the episode's name, it was a throwback to Rhaegar and Lyanna's marriage, showing Jon and Dany's love in parallel, while revealing Jon's name is actually Aegon Targaryen. The only parallel bit left to show was Dany getting pregnant with Jon's kid, like Lyanna did with Rhaegar's. And then the Targ dies. So basically it means Dany will die while Jon will father their logic and continue the Fire+(Fire+Ice) branch?Just yesterday I was whingeing to my friend how they have laid waste to the book plot by having Jon and Dany together.One thing: why does Bran insist Jon’s real name is Aegon Sand if he already knows Lyanna named him Aegon Targaryen? I think the showmakers just wanted to remind Samwell of the records he transcribed in the Citadel.I actually felt as if they had casted the same Harry Lloyd, with the same hair wig for Rhaegar. Just a bit taller, until I googled “Rhaegar Targaryen actor”. This was the exact vision Dany has of Rhaegar in tHoU – a man looking exactly like Viserys, just a bit taller and a different eye color. I like how the showmakers represent him exactly like Dany sees him in the books.Arya and Sansa don't have any differences. They acknowledge each other. We hear Ned Stark's line that we heard in Sansa's voice in S7 trailer. It adds cherry to the cake.I wonder how is the NK screaming “suvion” (High Valyrian for “ice”) at the undead Viserion if he's mute.Tormund and Beric ought to be dead. And Gendry too if he's still at the Wall (point 5).The episode was predictable.
s07e07	It’s official.Game of Thrones has officially ruined my taste.Twofold are my observations.Maybe thematically that works: two impressions. It’s like the twin themes of Ice and Fire, diametrically opposed, yet hooking up in a way that is so beautiful it can only result in Kit Harrington.Only instead of Ice and Fire, it’s A Song of Stupid and Awesome. Stupidity and awesomenosity: two different poles of a unified whole.Because that was stupid in so many ways. And I loved it.What I liked about it though is that (finally) they managed to hit on something that I have always liked about the story, but which drives me nuts in the show because of it’s absense.When Jon Snow refuses to lie to Cersei, acting like a typical “stupid Stark” and everyone is like “nice going, JON, you dummy.” I was thinking, actually Jon is right. Not because it is the right thing to do, but because it does make sense. Why lie to the people who you are going to be fighting for? The Northern way is the best way: and I think that message came through (however dumbed down the story had to become to make it happen) with the northern story line too. The pack survives: family trumps ambition and politics; those who seek to divide us with cleverness and lies are the ones we should strike down.Maybe because I have been thinking about division lately: how Trump or whoever’s propaganda machine whoever has so deftly divided people: not only in the US. Right now the political world is all about division and highlighting that and emphasizing it. But anyway: it resonated with me.Still, I had to laugh when they all took turns piling on Jon, and his reactions was, “I know, I know, I’m a dumb Stark, I can already see the memes coming on Facebook.Officially Confirmed; wights can’t swim. I’m telling you: too many holes.Clegane-bowl is definitely coming.The Cersei-Tyrion scene did not work for me at all. The writing had no real feeling in it: the lines felt perfunctory and by the number: yet Lena Heady and Peter Dinklage were trying so very, very, very hard!Man they were acting their asses off in an attempt to sell that shit. I expected them to whip out a cane and a bowler cap and start doing a tap dance, in unison, they were trying so hard. I guess when you get paid 2 million dollars per episode, or whatever, you give it your all!!But it didn’t work for me. I feel like Dinklage needs to be held back a bit: he starts chewing the scenery when he can get a chance. Of course that is better than Nikolai Coster-Waldau who always looks like he is threatening to cry, you can hear him thinking: (Look, audience, I can make myself cry, ain’t I talented?)I am officially shipping this.Cersei, of course, as the anti-Stark, was telling fibs the whole way. I had read spoiler about that, so it came as no surprise, but I think that it was obvious that she was never going to not be political: she is really Trump-like, when I think about it. (Sorry for all the Trump references: he is crammed down our throats twenty-four seven, I am seeing Trump everywhere: I swear to god I thought of him while watching Pac-Man cartoon with my son today.)I’m glad that Jaime finally got some balls and left…and may I say that the montage of snow scenes over the battlements, walls and various locations in King’s Landing was gorgeously done? I mean, that is why the episode was so long: there were so many gorgeous set up shots and so on. I liked that. I am looking forward to 80 minute episodes in Season 8, assuming I live long enough to ever see it.Theon and Jon. That scene meant something to me, even though the dialogue was kind of awful. But it worked for me, nevertheless. I do respond to the idea that Theon is sort of the dark Jon, the outsider who went criminal instead of letting his outsider-ness ennoble him. And Jon, bless his heart redeemed him. Just took three little words: I forgive you.So then he goes out all redeemed, on the Stark side. Ah, but the Greyjoy side is NOT redeemed. The Greyjoy side has to literally beat some beardo to death and then baptize himself, reborn in blood and water, to be redeemed. but he does it. And how does he do it? By letting himself get kicked repeatedly in what used to be his nuts!!!! It’s like he gained superhuman powers with every blow landed until he was a mighty and unstoppable nutless killing machine and he beat that beard’s head into the sand!!!!It’s like that Arthurian story about the guy who is weak in the day time but then he gets kicked in the nuts and becomes super strong.But he has redeemed himself: we saw him baptize himself: it is official. Now he is off to rescue Yara in one of those little rowboats: they are going to row around Westeros. That is OK: they have until 2019 to get there.Danerys: You’re dumb, but I like you anyway, Jon Snow.Jon: I think you are special.Of course we all predicted the Sansa/Arya/LIttlefinger storyline. Yes, LIttlefinger is really stupid. I can see why people bitch about this storyline. But honestly, I liked it. It was utterly predictable, had more plotholes than a animated dead dragon’s wings, but it just went down so smooth, like an oreo liqueur mixed with coffee and whipped cream.Yes it is sickly sweet but it just feels so right. Don’t question it. Just go with it and cheer when Arya walks over to Littlefinger and slices dat throat and blood spurts all over the place and then you see Bran and Sansa watching in their chairs. It rocked for me.I am officially stupid. Sue me. And I loved the little shout-out to Ned Stark that the girls give as they are standing on the battlement, all pack-like and toasty warm in their furs.Littlefinger in that scene, in my opinion, gave by far the greatest performance in the entire Season 7 (not that there is much competition.) I mean I totally bought it, all of it. The look on his face was priceless: the tears of fear, the annoying tone, the slight whine. Kudos to Aidan what’s-his-name, who is finally free to act in something else.Sam: Hey, Bran, remember me?Bran: Yo, Sam.Sam: what up?Bran: I’m the 3Icrow, yo.Sam: cool, what that.Bran: I can see things, like everywhere, man.Sam: Cool, do me a favor and go look to confirm that Rhaegar and Lyanna got married, will you?Bran: Hold on. Holy shit! They totally did. that means: (turns to audience) J-O-N I-S H-E-I-R t-o- t—h-e I-R-O-N T-H-R-O-N-E. )Tyrion doesn’t need weirwood or glass candles: he has his own little redtube on the ship. Cue ominous music for, like, no discernible reason whatsoever. Audience goes, oh, they are such a sexy couple: oh, no, Tyrion is unhappy? Ominous music is playing. Whatever will go wrong?!!!So like the dragon with holes in its wings like spouts blue fire that is also kind of cold, like ice-fire and it doesn’t melt ice or make it colder it like totally blows it up and then the walls come crumbling down.And if you listen to it on headphones, as I did, the choir chants “A Song of ice and fire” while the Dragon blows up everything. Cause he is like fire made ice. I swear it.
s07e06	GAME OF THRONES SEASON 7 EPISODE 6 (BEYOND THE WALL)The party is moving beyond the wall. The members are bonding together. Tormund and Jon have a buddy-buddy chat. Jorah has his Japanese moment: “I brought shame onto my house” after a nice talk with Jon. Tormund and Hound bond too. Also, gingers are kissed by the fire! Yay, my ginger beard! Tormund tells the Hound: “you are not mean. You have sad eyes.” This is one of the best dialogues in the 7th season. Jon and Beric talk seemingly serious stuff with dramatic voices.All this bonding of characters implies that the show is trying to combine the characters for a common cause. As Beric says “death is the enemy.”In Winterfell, Arya is being impulsive. After discovering Sansa’s letter, she confronts her. Not only is she being unreasonable – as obviously Sansa was forced to write that letter – but she is also spreading hate: “I remember your fancy dress, your fancy hair.” This seems to me the continuation of Arya’s childhood hate against Sansa. She didn’t let go of it. We all know that if Arya were in Sansa’s place, she already would have been dead. And that is exactly what Sansa tells Arya.I think the show spoiled the character of Arya. She was a little cute girl whom we liked from the beginning. Now, she is heartless and cold, caring only about killing. I mean, yeah, it was expected that she could turn cold after all the things she has seen but… isn’t this a little too much?!Tyrion and Daenerys chat. It has been, what, 3rd, 4th allusion of Dany’s dying? It would be interesting to see when Daenerys will die. I doubt it will happen this season as the show is still building the Jon-Dany romance.The bear kills Thoros of Myr. In the meantime, Hound has to man up about the fire-fright.Sansa shares her concerns with Littlefinger – not sure why. Littlefinger tries to instigate the drama by asking provocative questions to Sansa. Good manipulation tactics, Petyr!A party of wights and a white walker appear. Jon and co. give them bait and kill the white walker. For some reason, all the wights die except for one. As Jon points out “maybe the white walker was the one who turned the wights.” This is very huge. This might mean that if humans manage to kill the Night’s King they will automatically kill all the wight army. But, boy, that would be bloody difficult.The guys are stranded on a frozen lake. The Night’s King and his army are patiently waiting for the lake to freeze again so they can attack. Of course, the Night’s King could simply kill Jon and others with some spears. It wouldn’t have been particularly difficult for him. To me, the only logical explanation seems that the Night’s King knew Daenerys would come and was waiting for her. This means the Night’s King has visions like Bran. Otherwise, it was a ridiculous and a big plothole.Gendry the Fastest runs to the Eastwatch and sends a raven to Daenerys the Savior who comes to the rescue of the party. Tyrion, once again, hints at Dany’s death: “everything will be lost if you die.” I can totally see her dying next season.Hound is bored and starts throwing rocks at the wights. The army of the dead realizes that the lake was frozen and the battle begins. All the unknown human characters die, of course, (well, TV shows…) The scene was shot beautifully but could be better. The dragons’ fire was damn cool!Tormund was packed with wights all over him. Nobody managed to bite him, right? Smart scene.Some other TV show stupidity: The Night’s King could simply bow at Drogon, who was far closer to him and was simply parking there, and also kill the company. Why not? Cause we do not need all the characters to die. Smart directors!Props to Daenerys for finally taking action when it’s necessary: I mean, leaving from that bloody place to not have another dragon killed. Seems to me like Daenerys is pretty good at keeping her temper when necessary. I assume she could also keep her temper when killing the Tarlys.Uncle Benjen is the real MVP! Already saved two Stark kids from dying. What did you accomplish in your life?! Anyway, Jon asks Benjen Stark to come with him. Benjen says “there is no time.” Actually there was time! I am not sure why Benjen stayed behind.In Winterfell, we get the Arya vs Sansa 2.0. Arya seriously frightens Sansa. Once again, the Winterfell arc seems ridiculous to me. What kind of crap is this? Let’s move on.Isn’t this romantic guys? Jon and Dany holding hands, making the show miserable and mainstream… bad Jon and Dany! Anyway, nothing interesting here, they would probably engage in intercourse next week. In the meantime, Jon decides to, well, “imaginary” bend the knee to Daenerys. I am not sure this was a smart decision. Bending the knee or not, Daenerys will help you already. Becoming her subjugate only complicates things with the Northern lords.Viserion rises from the dead. Good boy! Going to break the wall or something, ain’t you?!SUMMARY:The meeting in the next episode among Jaime, Tyrion and Brienne will be interesting. I don’t expect Cersei to have an alliance with Jon and Dany. She will wait for them to lose their strength, I believe.Remember Sam? He is going back to Winterfell. He and Bran might still come up with something regarding either Jon’s Targaryen blood or how to defeat the White Walkers.Sansa and Arya child-game plotline reminds me of my times, watching Sponge Bob and Tom and Jerry. I don’t expect anything interesting to happen here. Most likely, Bran will interfere and they would kill Littlefinger. With only 9 episodes left to the show’s ending, I doubt they would let Littlefinger on board.And, please, please, please, cut the Dany and Jon romance. It’s sooooo daaaaamn predictable and mainstream, I don’t even feel like I am watching the Game of Thrones anymore. Most likely, one of them is going to die in the next season. The other one would avenge his/her lover.Overall, the episodes in season 7 are shot well – the battles are cool, the dragons rock! – but the writing? Meh!
s07e06	*THIS ANSWER CONTAINS LEAKED CONTENT FROM THE PENULTIMATE EPISODE OF GAME OF THRONES**IF YOU HAVEN’T SEEN THE LEAKS YET PLEASE DO NOT SCROLL DOWN PAST THIS POINT*Got that?Wow. Another leak. Dammit Spain and Norway! This isn’t even that one HBO hacker’s fault. Are there employees in HBO Espana, HBO Nordic, and Star India working for the hackers? Who knows?But the question isn’t about the mystery of these leaks; it’s the review of the leaked episode. So without further ado, let’s begin.Side note before we begin: Why do I think the Game of Thrones theme sounds more melancholic than usual? It looks like the entire thing has transposed itself into the diminished keys! Even the HBO ‘aaah’ thing sounds more sad!Beyond the WallWe got the ol’ Fellowship of the Wights, walking just like the actual Fellowship of the Ring in LOTR, but with a snowier setting.Awesome dialogue between Tormund and Gendry. Also, Gendry’s still salty about the Brotherhood selling Gendry off to Melisandre.Jon gets into a conversation with Jorah about his father Jeor Mormont. Jon tries to give Longclaw to Jorah, which shows his awesome character, but of course Jorah refuses. Shame, though, since a small part of me wanted Lyanna Mormont wielding that sword.The Hound does amazing banter with Tormund, as we see why we love these two characters.Side note: Tormund’s still in love with Brienne of Tarth, and his reaction to the Hound’s reference of Brienne cracks me up every time.Beric talks to Jon about the Lord of Light like a Jehovah’s Witness trying to convince me to learn more about God on my doorstep.The mountain like an arrowhead unfortunately isn’t capital-M Mountain (Gregor Clegane), but they reach the actual mountain and so the Fellowship camps there.Anyways, a full-on blizzard is now in effect. I’m not sure if it happened all of a sudden as time in Season 7 is really tricky.WIGHT POLAR BEAR ATTACK! Closest thing we come to a jumpscare in Game of Thrones (sorry, Jorah’s arm). This entire scene could fit in a horror movie and I would still be fine. Visibility’s pretty much zero now.The polar bear goes for it again (warning: very loud roars) and numerous redshirts die. Luckily Beric takes care of it with his flaming sword, which would prove useful.Side note: Sandor’s still a bit scared of fire.It looks like Thoros of Myr is wounded after that polar bear fight, and Beric thinks Thoros will die from the wound.Anyways, the Fellowship continue on, unfazed by the polar bear attack, and Thoros still joins them despite the wound in his chest. That man’s courage is higher than the Wall. Also, the blizzard clears, because plot.Jon and Tormund meanwhile spy on a group of wights, and the Fellowship begin to attack them, surprising a White Walker who’s just chilling by a river. Jon then kills that White Walker because he’s a badass.As the Fellowship deal with the last of the wights, Jon hears an ominous sound, and is terrified. However, they got their wight, and Jon tells the Fellowship to skedaddle.Their luck leaves them and they are stuck in a frozen lake which begins to crack, while the wights are getting closer, scary as ever.My god, this is ominous. The Fellowship’s running through the frozen lake, and holy smokes, the wights are almost right behind them. Suspense builds. Random redshirt dies.Of course, lake ex machina takes hold, and the wights fall into the lake, which was crumbling from the weight of the Fellowship’s boot. The Fellowship themselves are on an island around the lake, SURROUNDED BY WIGHTS (they aren’t stupid, you know).As night falls, suspense builds even more due to a lack of a soundtrack and the look of unease among Jon and the Fellowship.Gendry (at least I think it’s Gendry, the darkness plus frostbite makes it hard to tell) though reaches Eastwatch and tells its brothers to send a raven south.All of a sudden, it’s day again, and Thoros has died of his wound with the polar bear. Beric burns his body with his sword.Jorah then realizes that when Jon killed that White Walker earlier in the episode, all the wights whom the White Walker turned it fell with it. This could be very important in the episodes to come.We see an intimidating shot of the Night King and the Four Horsemen, and even with that the Hound still continues his amazing banter. Gotta love the Hound.One lone wight begins to advance among the island, and other wights follow that one wight’s lead. I’m getting Hardhome flashbacks now and my heart is racing.Some awesome Fellowship vs Wight fight scenes! Every single one is badass in this scene, though as we see from an aerial shot, it’s not looking well for the Fellowship.Side note: Why don’t they all rush towards them? The wights look like they’re going one-by-one. Whatever, I still like the fight scenes, but still.Though they hold their own, the Fellowship retreat into the island, as the numbers of the wight starts to overwhelm them. Also, more redshirts die.Of note: Tormund escaping from those wights who want to drag him into the water.Just as all hope is lost, Dany arrives in the scene and initiates Operation Dragon-Ex-Machina, burning the wights. I’m glad she’s taken this White Walker thing seriously.Of course, we can’t expect the Night King to sit back and do nothing while the dragons are there, so he shows the world his awesome javelin skills, and knocks down a dragon. That collective gasp you heard were all the Dany fanboys and fangirls. Viserion (I think?) crashlands into the lake, and presumably dies. Everyone’s shocked, of course, especially Dany.After a few seconds of mourning, Dany is forced to get out as the wights are closing in, leaving Jon as he is dragged under by wights. The Night King does his second javelin attempt, hoping to get a gold medal in the Westerosi Winter Games, but Drogon manages to dodge it.Jon Snow eventually gets out of the lake, and is now alone. He’s in a bad situation, and accepts his fate, but good ol’ Benjen Stark saves him, and sacrifices his life as Jon gets on his horse.Last shot of the episode: Viserion is back from the dead and has become a dragon wight, as he’s pulled by the wights. The Night King comes to Viserion and turns him into the wight. The folks down south should be worried. So worried.WinterfellArya shows Sansa that letter she found last episode, and Sansa really wants Arya not to read it. She reads it anyways just because.Sansa defends herself, but Arya doesn’t believe her. It’s only been what, two episodes, and their relationship is already falling apart. Props to Maisie Williams for showing that emotion.Arya continues cross-examining Sansa, who tries to defuse this situation. I’m with Sansa on this argument, as she was only used as a pawn to write that letter, won the Bastardbowl for Jon, and made the North stable.Arya then threatens to tell Lyanna Mormont about this, to which Sansa is visibly upset. Yeesh, the political drama is interesting.Littlefinger, being Littlefinger, begins to try and influence Sansa to turn from Jon Snow, while Sansa worries about what Arya’s going to do with the letter.Sansa then gets a letter inviting her to King’s Landing, though she refuses as she thinks it’s a trap. I don’t blame her, as last time Sansa was in King’s Landing bad things happened. Brienne then volunteers to go, but warns her of Littlefinger, though Sansa denies her help. Really, Sansa?Side note: Ominous Stark theme is ominous.Sansa’s rummaging around Winterfell when he finds Arya’s bag, and discovers her disguises. She’s horrified, and is even more horrified when she gets caught by Arya red-handed.Arya then talks about her Faceless Men training to Sansa, and says that she’ll play a game with Sansa. It’s kinda like Two Truths and a Lie (you have to make the lie sound convincing) but it’s done with questions instead. Sansa, of course, doesn’t want to play. Arya then talks about the faces which enable her to be someone else.Okay, now Arya’s taking that dagger, and Sansa’s now really really internally scared as she paces towards her. She’s relieved when Arya decides to give the dagger to Sansa, though she’s still pretty horrified.DragonstoneDany talks about Drogo, Jorah, Daario, and Jon Snow, and Tyrion points out they all like her. Dany also says Tyrion isn’t a hero, though that isn’t necessarily a bad thing.I’m glad Dany is listening to Tyrion again after her outburst against him at S7E4. They are talking about the negotiations with Cersei, and Tyrion points out that Dany shouldn’t be impulsive. It’s good that Tyrion’s influence prevents Dany from becoming full-Aerys.Tyrion then brings out a brilliant piece of advice to think from your enemy’s point of view to see what their intentions are. He also suggests democracy (examples he brings up is the Kingsmoot in the Iron Islands and the Night’s Watch) though Dany’s preferring to wait for after she wears the crown.Dany gets into a white winter outfit (side note: not a fan), and decides to help Jon, though Tyrion tries to convince her otherwise, as her chances of dying skyrocket. It fails. Dany goes onto Drogon, and her other two dragons Viserion and Rhaegal (FINALLY WE SEE THEM) join her.A bit later, after all the kerfuffle beyond the wall, Jon Snow wakes up on the Targaryen ship to find Dany watching over him, still turned-on. She’s changed to Outfit #3.Anyways, Jon’s feeling deep regret over what happened to Viserion, but Dany assures him it’s okay, and tells him she is now fully committed to stopping the White Walkers. She’s finally not telling him to bend the knee anymore, which is great, and finally respects Jon as King in the North.EastwatchThe Hound says goodbye to the Brotherhood, and Beric says they will meet again, as Dany and Jorah is on top of the Wall silently mourning Viserion (and presumably Jon Snow as well). They then see a lone horse.Turns out Jon’s back at the south side of the Wall, and he is treated aboard a Targaryen ship by Davos Seaworth.When he’s healed, he gets a visit from Dany, who sees first-hand the scars that Jon had when he got stabbed by Alliser “Backstabber” Thorne and “Fuckin’” Olly. Dany, of course, is silently turned-on.This episode continues the tradition of penultimate episodes in Game of Thrones being amazing. The battle scene at the lake is particularly noted, and it kept my heart racing and my hairs high. The politics up in Winterfell is also beginning to take shape, and Maisie Williams makes Arya Stark look so flipping terrifying. The only problem I have is that the writers are placating the Jonerys shippers by, well, shipping them. But I’m glad to see Dany’s finally taking the White Walkers seriously.
s07e06	A number game first. S7E6. 7go,but only 6 return.Some observations and predictions from this episode1.The journey begins.The Longclaw is offered back to house Mormont and refused. Also,the sword doesn’t drown even when Jon himself does, later in this episode. Therefore,it seems to me, the sword has some major part to play in S8, other than killing WW. Or maybe, it’s symbolic. Jorah relinquishes his position of being the show’s suitor for Dany. In favor of Jon. Tormund convinces Jon bending the knee saves a lot of lives at times.The ragtag bunch glib around and give each other a hard time.2.Arya brings up the scroll with Sansa. Of course, the sisters don’t get along very well and they haven’t settled their childhood differences. But we are reminded of something significant for the future. As long as that scroll exists, chances of Sansa remaining the lady of Winterfell are slim.Just like her direwolf. It survived the death of its wolf-mother, but couldn’t survive the title of ‘lady’ for much long. There’s a smoking gun here fellows, and I am sure the writers would love to use it.3.The Hound and Tormund have the best-written conversation of this season. Expect the Hound to be scathing, and Tormund to beam in the face of insults. Although, Tormund doesn’t beam, he LOLs. Or guffaws, whatever.Both have a common topic-Brienne of Tarth. One has lost a fight to her, the other has lost his heart to her.But however mindless you think Tormund is,this is PR 101. When on a perilous path,its good to make acquaintance with a few strangers.Often it can save your skin.Meanwhile, Beric educates Jon about the will of Lord of Light. To fight for those who can’t hep themselves, and keep fighting the only enemy-death. Even when the inevitability catches up. That would be enough for a life’s motive. Good proselytizing. He also observes how Jon doesn’t look like Ned.( Although Jon has tried his level best to look like Ned.) GoT keeps harping on the same note every episode.4.Dany and Jon’s chemistry is out in the open for the first time. When our favourite dwarf finds an opportune moment to catch Dany at her words. Dany refuses, but does the worst rationalising in the history of Westeros. And, stumbles further.Hook, line, sinker. Good to see Tyrion getting some meaningful lines at the least , if not meaningful results. But then he brings up the thorny topic of Dany’s succession and the Dragon queen is pissed. The show has already started to foreshadow Dany’s death, and her successor(Dany’s child with Jon perhaps?) Maybe this will conduce the queen to take a new lover.5. The bear charges and rips apart Thoros. Thoros isn’t a big fighter, although he has got one of those flaming swords(medieval Star wars saber anyone?) The Hound stands by watching as he can’t come close to a fire. Something tells me, he will have to overcome this fear next season when he (hopefully) finally redeems himself. During Cleaganbowl. Also it's no cheap CGI,so we can expect a number of wight teddies next season.This was probably a sensitizing dose,so that we are not surprised later.6. We get to understand why LF lead Arya to that letter in the first place. A. He is the ultimate fan of chaos. Two Starks fighting at Winterfell is chaos. B. It puts him in a position to side with Sansa and take out Arya without getting on Sansa’s bad side. C. To get Sansa to share her inner thoughts with him, which he hasn’t been privy to in a long time. D. To remind Sansa that Brienne is no longer Sansa’s personal guard. If any harm were to befall Arya, Brienne would rise up in arms.7. In Loot Train, Bronn hears the enemy before Jaime. Here, Tormund hears them before Jon. GoT has got to disperse credits uniformly. They find one deadbeat wight, but can’t stop it from screaming ‘mayday, mayday’. The SoS is heard and more wights turn up. Gendry is dispatched to Eastwatch because he’s the fastest. Don’t know how Jon knows that.They didn’t have a race before the quest, did they? Anyway the wights encircle them on thin ice but cannot cross over as the ice layer keeps giving away.Meanwhile Gendry falls down, out of breath, but that happens right in front of Eastwatch draw gate and Davos finds him in no time.Pretty convenient sequences if I may. Thoros dies. Irony is that he saved someone 6 times, but couldn’t resurrect himself.It seems if you hurt one wight, all growl together. Later they conclude if the WW is killed, the wights he had raised from the dead disintegrate on their own. Therefore, if NK is killed, every undead goes back to being dead.8.Sansa gets invited to the meeting at KL. But she can’t go, and decides to send Brienne because A. She is really afraid of Cersei. B. She is really afraid of Arya, and what her little sister might do if left in charge. C. She is really afraid of Brienne, and cannot have her at Winterfell if things turn sour with Arya.She snaps at Brienne. Because A. She needs to vent after the altercation with her sissy and she can only act tough around good people(Jon, Brienne,etc) B. She doesn’t want to let Brienne linger any longer and sense what’s wrong with Sansa.9.Dany risks herself and risks her life to go save the group. After the hatred she was getting for Loot Train, I hope this puts some minds to peace. She might be tough with the shady ones, but when she finds nobility, she can be selfless. She puts on a white dress first time this season.Maybe to show she's finally doing something good,or maybe just because it would be a good camoflauge north of the wall.10. The Hound thinks he can entertain others by fooling around. He messes up, and sends a formal invitation to the wights(one looks inspired from Terminator) to come get them. The irony is he pelts a brainless wight(you see that he is all skeleton, so has no brains at all) and points out that the wight is dumb. The wight probably takes insult and proves to be not so dumb afterall. The fight ensues. The Hound decides to save Tormund so that atleast someone can f*** up Brienne of tarth, if we are being literal :P Right then, Dany swoops in with her dragons-all three of them. The F22 raptors lay waste to many undead with fervent glee. Dany keeps getting back some love she’d lost in episode 4. She offers lift to Jon first. But Jon, being Jon, would like to stay back until others make it.Now, the saddest moment of the season happens. Viserion is struck by NK, and the poor beast dies gushing blood all over the snow. Before it drowns in the lake. And with it, our hearts sink. This scene actually teared me up. Just like Wun Wun’s death last year.GoT has a penchant for hurting us where it hurts the most .However, NK has to be handed spears since he seems to have undead vesrion of gout or undead version of ego. Or else, he could have killed all three. Jon sees that he’s being handed another spear and asks the rescue party to leave. Before being shoved into water by some wights himself. Dany gets the time to take off.NK throws the spear again, but with a rider, a dragon is better at handling itself.Dany seems beside herself with grief,and our hearts go out to her. Even the frozen lake swarming with undead looks like the outline of a dragon, in homage to the fallen beast. That’s why she has been telling all season that the dragons are like her children, and they certainly are the only ones she’ll ever have. But now, the death of one may force her to decide on begetting another child.Jon, being Jon, decides on a bad time to stop playing possum. He gets up to face the wights, who were leaving him alone. Can you believe that? But whenever Jon takes a stand alone, help arrives. Commoners aren't so lucky in GoT.Well, Coldhands stroms in, and rattles a few cages.. skeletons. Jon gets to meet uncle Benjen as he’d wished since season 1. It was what got him trapped and then killed, and this time it saves him. But another Stark dies this season. Can’t remember a season where no Stark had to die.( I have been told, season 2 and 4)On a side note, can a horse run like that on snow? I wonder.11.Dany waits for Jon at East watch.When he returns and is laid to rest she sees him.Both his scars and nudity are revealed to her.12. Sansa check Arya’s room for the scroll. One of the most intriguing mystery of the fine arts of Faceless Men is how they mimic the victim’s voice and height. The writers make Arya say it can be done, but they conveniently(again) leave out the finer details. Arya simply intimidates her elder sister and leaves. I have a feeling she’s enjoying their little meetings much more than her sister.13. In the boat where they will be later found frolicking(in the next episode), Jon opens his eyes and Dany is sitting right by his side. The first thing he talks about is her loss, and not about his own travails. Proud of you, Jonny boy! Very Chivalrous. Dany gets a good look at Jon’s scars, and maybe she realises Northerner’s weren’t having any flights of fancy when it came to Jon taking a dagger in the heart.The loss of her child has made her unequivocal enemy of NK and she pledges Jon her support before Jon offers his fealty to ‘Dany”. Yes, they are seemingly on first name terms now. This is forbidden romance galloping at full tilt. They hold hands before she leaves his chamber.14. Viserion is chained and raised from the frozen lake.Then NK touches him, and the corpse is reanimated. The dragon opens its blue eyes. In a Stark contrast to Jon touching Drogon last episode.Two very important takeawaysKill the NK alone, and the rest of the undead turn to dust.A dragon needs a rider in the battlefield.——————————————End of episode———————————————
s07e06	All right, here it is.Ah, the expositional talking that I predicted in an earlier answer. Still, it is well executed, and I love Sandor shutting down Gendry’s whinging. He would make a great life coach after the war against the Others is won. To me, this beginning cleared up the reason for Beric’s survival in the show, over and above cutting out Lady Stoneheart. The Lady is driven entirely by vengeance, whereas the show is turning Beric into Jon’s How to be a resurrected warrior of R’hllor, guiding him more and more towards the path of the Lord of Light. The conversation between them was the beginning of this. I loved Beric’s quip you take after your mother to Jon. Yes he does, my friend, indeed he does.As predicted, Jon tried to restore the sword of House Mormont to the last living Mormont on the show of fighting age, Ser Jorah. Jorah was unusually generous though, bestowing the blade on Jon and his children, even though technically the right to do belongs to Lady Lyanna Mormont. The conversation between Tormund and Sandor was amazing to watch, as was Sandor’s wait, what moment when he inferred that the lady Tormund was talking about was none other than Brienne of Tarth.There is one other notable theme in all this exposition. It is this. For all the things that Gendry has suffered, he is still very much the wet-behind-the-ears junior partner in this enterprise, and the show makes sure to remind him, and us, of this.And then, the intrigue begins. As predicted, the letter that LF planted on Arya is the same one that Cersei had Sansa write under duress. We know that, but Arya doesn’t, since she’d already murdered a boy by then and gone on the run, her life forfeit if she was caught. and she doesn’t care if Sansa was under duress or not. This might seem unfair to Sansa, but remember, these are old wounds that were never addressed until now. Arya responded to her father’s arrest and the slaughter of their household by going on the run, while Sansa was directly responsible for those two events as a result of her naive panic over not marrying Joffrey, a nerve that Arya does not fail to prick.Arya hated Joffrey, Cersei and the whole lot from the capital right from the instant she was forced to abandon Nymeria to the wild. Sansa was devastated by the loss of Lady, but she considered her direwolf almost purely as a pet (which influenced Lady’s behaviour through the mental link that Sansa never explored), and therefore her death didn’t sour Sansa towards the KL crowd as much as the loss of Nymeria affected Arya.Sansa’s suffering has been more subtle, except for her marriage to Ramsay Snow, while Arya’s journey has been viscerally violent from the moment Syrio Forel told her to run. From the deaths of Yoren and Lommy to working as a servant at Harrenhal to serving as cupbearer to both Tywin Lannister and Roose Bolton, I personally don’t think there is any merit to Sansa’s argument that Arya would not have survived the things Sansa did. Sansa suffered those things because she allowed herself to be used as a pawn by literally everyone in KL, while Arya removed herself from the chessboard at the first opportunity.And here once again, we are treated to GRRM’s recreation of Aegon I and his sisters in the form of Jon, Arya and Sansa. Rhaenys and Visenya were diametrically opposite, and Visenya was just as much feared as she was respected, while Rhaenys was loved. Sansa has earned the love of the northerners, and is afraid of losing it, while Arya cares only to preserve their respect and fear of Jon, even at the expense of Sansa. The sisters’s conflicting stances on the consequences of anger vs fear as motivating factors further illustrates their differences. Sansa is a survivor who believes in survival at any cost, while Arya would gladly discount survival over kneeling.The scene with LF is just plain stupidity by Sansa, and it shows that she’s still got that Electra complex going strong for him. Last week, she counseled Bran to be cautious over the gift of a dagger and now she’s consulting that same guy over differences with her sister. The one redeeming feature is that Bran is still absent in all this, and he will come into play big-time in the next episode, where he will reconcile the sisters and cause LF’s downfall and death. Arya giving the dagger to Sansa was the ultimate power move, she’s basically saying that if she wanted to harm Sansa, nothing would stop her. And I’m looking forward to LF soiling himself when Sansa asks him who the Faceless Men are and informs him that Arya is full-fledged member of that society.We are then treated to the continued shoehorning of the Jon-Daenerys romance subplot. Tyrion makes a valid point towards Daenerys making out a succession plan, which Daenerys miscontrues and postpones the matter until she becomes the Queen. I loved how he quietly remonstrated against Daenerys for her unnecessary execution of the Tarlys. His statements about the world Daenerys is trying to build seems increasingly like he’s trying to convince himself. As for my own two cents on the matter, breaking the wheel is officially Make Westeros great again for me, and equally reprehensible.The non-named characters on Jon’s team should have been given red cloaks or something, because there was no way they were going to survive. An undead polar bear, another example of how the showrunners have bested GRRM in creating visual spectacles and set pieces that exceed the author’s narration. All hail Thoros of Myr, a fighting man, who lived as no Priest of R’hllor would want to and died the way every one of them would envy, fighting a creature brought to un-life by the power of the Great Other. I respect the show for not making some big showpiece out of his death, or turning it into an extended chase sequence. They let him live through the injury largely on his feet and let him die peacefully. Well done, I say.Sandor Clegane will never be throwing rocks at anything ever again, I think I can guarantee that. It was a clever line of thought by the Others, and by the writers, to figure out that groups one or two wights could get to the center of the frozen lake where the entire army could not. Also, this siege must have lasted weeks on end, considering the time it would take Gendry, an utter newcomer, to run back to Eastwatch, a raven to be sent to Dragonstone, where Daenerys receives the raven and gets on her way, reaches Eastwatch and gets directions to where Jon is. This weeks-long siege would be an awesome spinoff series on its own.Jon has gotten suspiciously good at killing Others. The one he killed at Hardhome tossed him around like a ragdoll, whereas, this one gets dispatched with a couple strikes and parries, with one feint followed by a standing slash. It was a bit predictable that the wight’s screams alerted the Others to the presence of Jon’s team, and yet for all the buildup, the Night’s King and his honor guard or ruling council that stood with him did not join the battle at all. Had one of them joined the battle, we would have known if there are differences and ranks among Others, with the Night’s King at the top with twelve Others by his side along with many subordinate ranks of their kind, or are they all the same except the Night’s King, who is the alpha.Viserion’s death was not mandatory, but it became necessary because the show didn’t bother to foreshadow ice dragons, and the showrunners want the visual spectacle of the Night’s King fighting the Mother of Dragons and Azor Ahai, with all three riding dragons. Also, D&D want us to be invested in the emotional tragedy of the death of one of Daenerys’s children and his transformation into the mount of the main villain. Daenerys-Drogon and Jon-Rhaegal are set in stone, so poor Viserion drew the short straw. And that short straw, better known as Tyrion of House Lannister, will not be pleased that the dragon he spoke to and freed from fetters died as a result of Daenerys not listening to his counsel, though in the bigger picture she was right to do what she did.Benjen was a narrative loose end that needed to be tied off and the show did a decent enough job of it. Benjen is almost certainly completely dead now, and it’s no accident that he arrived at the exact right time to save Jon. Bran sent his uncle to go sacrifice himself to protect his cousin, which means that Bran is playing a game of chess with the Night’s King across space and time. More disturbingly, did Bran foresee the deaths of Thoros and Viserion, and allow the mission to proceed anyway?Additionally, the scene where Daenerys sees Jon’s scars and realizes that he did take a knife to the heart for his people, who are not just the northerners, but all the living people in Westeros. It probably takes her back to her own rebirth in Drogo’s funeral pyre, and I think she realizes that while her resurrection was metaphorical and he’s touched by fire magic in his own way, perhaps even more directly than she is. This will ease them closer together and lead her to privately suspect that Jon is neither Jon or Snow. The reveal of his identity and his claim superseding her will hit her like a 200-pound sledgehammer, but until then she and Jon will have a honeymoon period while Jon recuperates and they sail to Dragonstone. She may even get pregnant during this time.As for Jon bending the knee to her, it will be invalidated the moment R+L=J is revealed. Jon Snow did bend the knee, but he is neither Jon or Snow, he is Aegon Targaryen, trueborn son and heir of Rhaegar, who was the anointed heir of Aerys II. Daenerys will be forced to admit that his vow of fealty is no longer valid since he now supersedes her in the line of succession, and in the eyes of the law, she is required to swear fealty to him. That will be a major downer to the romantic side of their relationship and the beginning, I hope, of a short but bloody Mad Daenerys storyline.
s07e06	I caved and watched the leak with a friend. Anyway, I was all for it, until the ending scene ruined it for me. But I'll break it down first.-ARYA AND SANSA-I truly believe that Arya is staging this to lure Petyr into a false sense of security. It just seems waaaaaaay over the top. Arya not only accuses Sansa of betraying her family (cruel but understandable) she threatens to turn the Northern lords against her and toys with her by saying she will skin off her face! Arya wouldn't do this. Sansa is still her sister and despite their differences, loves her! I am also disappointed in Sansa. While she rightly defended herself, she crawled right back into Littlefinger’s palm. Really!? But I told myself hey, maybe they will surprise me. Maybe Sansa is in on Arya’s plot too, and this is all after they consulted Bran off-screen….that would be awesome.-TYRION & DANY-This scene struck a cord with me because I was sure that we were seeing some Aerys-Style paranoia from DanyTyrion genuinely wants Dany to succeed but in a way that doesn't harm innocents. He brings up his distaste for the Tarly execution, which she brushes off.Then….Tyrion mentions the dangers of not having a successor. Dany’s reaction?“You’ve been talking a lot about my death lately…are you plotting with your brother against me?”I thought, it’s started, the first signs of madness.Then her scene with Jon came out of nowhere.-THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE WHITEWALKER-Jon and Co. have some interesting conversations, including Jorah letting Jon keep Longclaw. Thought it was very moving. The battle with the dead was tense and well done, as expected. Part of me is glad Tormund didn't die, but it seems unrealistic that all the important people survived. I was sure we'd lose Tormund AND Davos this episode.Gendry is sent back to tell the others to send a text message to Daenerys. She ignores Tyrion’s warnings and flies back to save them…JUST in the nick of time. How convenient.In the heat of the battle, poor Viserion is shot down and Jon is left behind. I loved this part because Dany finally lost something close to her, and things did not go as easily as they usually do for her.-GOT THE SOAP OPERA-Jon awakes to a grieving Daenerys, who has seen his scars. Cue the most cheesy, OOC dialogue ever for BOTH characters.While it's nice to see a human moment for Dany, this scene should have been with Jorah. They bonded since Season 1, and while she is not in love with Jorah, she has always shown her vulnerability to him and him alone. You'd think she'd have a moment with him after he just got back from what was a suicidal mission.Nope. She instead opens her heart completely to Jon, a stranger, and lets him call her “Dany”. Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, the Unburnt, the the Breaker of Chains, the Mother of Titles, lets this random guy she just met and rebelled against her rule, call her “Dany”.And Jon, who seems to realize out of nowhere that bending the knee was allll his pride talking, pledges fealty to Daenerys as his queen. Thanks for giving the North’s independence to this pyromaniac with a Messiah complex, Jon. Yup, real good leadership there. Let's not even begin to mention that you loved Ygritte, with all your heart, AND STILL REFUSED TO BETRAY THE WATCH.But nope. Now he suddenly feels the need to bend the knee and accept Dany as his queen. Even after she already agreed to fight for the north. But it's okay! Dany is such a sweet special snowflake that every “good” character realizes the errors of their ways! They all eventually realize that they were being so mean and unfair by not pledging fealty and have a change of heart!….Ugh.
s07e06	When Tormund compares Jon not kneeling to Mance (“How many of his people died for his pride”) it felt like a foreshadowing of Jon bending the kneeI like how Jon and Jorah bonded over their dads & Longclaw. These two men respect each other and it’s going to make the love triangle all that more unbearable.Does Jorah implying Jon will pass Longclaw to his children mean he believes Jon will have kids with Daenerys? Will Jon awaken the dragon in her or something? The woman said Dany will never have children again, (this comes up later), and this episode reiterated that message. Nothing is ever brought up for nothing.Tormund learning the word ‘dick’ was so funny. Even funnier when he said he liked it and the Hound said, “I bet you do”.I like how they showed different pairs in the group bonding. Especially Tormund’s “I want to make babies with her (Brienne)”.Tyrion: “I suppose he stares at you longingly because he’s hopeful for a successful military alliance”. I speak this way with my friends when they don’t realize someone has a crush on them.The moment Thoros got mauled by the bear, I knew he was going to die. They wouldn’t go back to the Eastwatch with the group in tact.Can we take a moment and appreciate the costume department. Dany’s new ice/bone-like dress is beautiful.Dany looked so relieved and happy to reach out and help Jon.Which dragon died? Seeing one dragon fly in the sky pulled at my heartstrings so much. Especially when you contrast that with seeing them take off from Dragonstone.If you look carefully, when Jon is submerged beneath the water, you see the wolf’s eyes on Longclaw are closed. The moment his hand reached out to grab the ice, you see the wolf’s eyes open. There’s some connection between Longclaw and Jon.I’m so glad Dany finally saw Jon’s scars. Now she knows Davos wasn’t being “dramatic”.Arya turned the power over to Sansa when she handed Sansa the dagger. I feel like this will come up later when Sansa realizes Little Finger betrayed her father. Hopefully Bran will be able to help in that area.JON CALLS DAENERYS “DANY”. The fact that the first person she thought of was her brother, a man who always looked down on her, is important because Jon will most likely be the exact opposite.That moment where Dany tries to take her hand away and Jon holds on was so intense. Dany stays and keeps looking into his eyes but then something clicks in her like, “Damn I’m a queen, what’s happening between us, we shouldn’t be holding hands like this”, and she withdraws her hand a second time.I’m so excited to see where they go with the wight dragon. We know from this episode that once you kill the lieutenant/king who turned the wights, they all die. So for the final battle, Jon will be going for the Night King himself and a lot of important characters will die trying to help him get there. The wight dragon will definitely cause some trouble before Jon kills the lieutenant/king that turned it.I’m both excited and dreading that final battle.
s07e06	Disclaimer: This is just my opinion. Judging by what others have said, it looks like I might get some hate for this answer, but just remember that it's my opinion. Feel free to pose thoughtful arguments in the comments, but just don't get hostile purely over something as trivial as a TV episode.My overall review of the episode was that I thoroughly disliked it. The only episode of this that I believe was subpar was "Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken". To begin, let's talk about the intial scene, which is, in my opinion, the highpoint of the episode. We get several very emotional, interesting conversations which reveal details about the characters (Gendry and the BwB, Jorah and Jon), and a bit of comic relief from the Hound and Tormund, a pairing I would definitely like to see more of. However, I am somewhat disappointed of how Gendry's conversation went nowhere. Did he forgive the Brotherhood without Banners? Nonetheless, this scene is a good intro. Unfortunately, things go downhill from here very quickly. Rather than addressing this episode scene-by-scene, I think it would be best to talk about it by location from this point forward. Next up is Winterfell, a section of the episode I am highly ambivalent about. Though the overall plot remains interesting and LittleFinger's manipulation is, as always, a highpoint, the dialogue is incredibly flat and the scenes simply feel out of place given the lack of consequentiality when compared with the other plotlines present. Had we seen some significant development in the story and character arcs here, I would have been much more pleased. However, we instead get a bunch of rushed scenes that don't feel nearly as connected as they should. Arya's reveal of her discovery, Sansa's dismissal of Brienne when she is needed more than ever, and Sansa's discovery of Arya's faces don't seem to string together in a coherent manner. The dialogue following Sansa's discovery is definitely a lowpoint in the episode, and we end up getting little to no resolution to this plotline. Arya appears to be allying with Sansa, though her motivations are never explained, which makes me particular angry.Daenerys is the next non-Wall section of I will talk about. This particular section features far too little plot development and seemingly dismisses the set-up "Daenerys is going mad and must be stopped" storyline set up in the previous episode. Every word out of her mouth made me immediately yell "fuck you!" at the screen of my desktop, but Tyrion does little to nothing to stop her and there seems to be no strain on their relationship. Tyrion remains her loyal servant, a constant reminder to how the show's most developed character transformed into its least-interesting, most static character. Daenerys does eventually leave, despite all warnings from Tyrion, but again, the buildup is completely let go. Tyrion does not get mad or put his foot down, he simply stares in horror, despite the fact that he had the same reaction last episode. An opportunity to make the episode much better is once again present, with Tyrion harboring a slew of pent-up emotions. An angry confrontation followed by a defiant Daenerys flying away filled with rage would have been a PERFECT inclusion. Perhaps she could banish Tyrion, leading him to head into a spiral towards sociopathy mirroring that in the books eventually resulting in him deciding to take her down along with Varys. But we get none of this, since D&D have no balls. They're afraid to create strife between two likeable characters or give Tyrion a negative arc. Once again, I am very displeased with this segment.Now that we have that out of the way, we get to the Wall bits, filled with plot holes, nonsensical plot developments, and boring, uninspired action. Thoros is mauled by a polar bear wight in a very boring action sequence, yet does not appear to have any significant wounds and can still walk several miles. The gang then takes out a bunch of wights and their leader in a very rushed sequence which is rendered incoherent by the camera's constant, ADHD cuts from one character to another. PICK ONE POV AND STAY WITH IT. I DON'T NEED TO SEE WHAT GENDRY IS DOING, I WANT TO SEE WHAT THE ONLY MAIN CHARACTER HERE FIGHTING THE ONLY WHITE WALKER HERE IS DOING. Anyway, all the wights drop dead after the WW is killed, save one whose prolonged existence is unexplained. After this, we head to an island in the middle of a frozen lake; an interesting idea for a battle, I admit, but one of which little comes. First of all, there is no need to have the wights wait to attack. Why not have them simply charge; what was the point of writing that in? The long period of insipid waiting on the island kills any tension that existed, a situation only worsened by the fact that the characters seem completely unfazed by this development. They're just sitting there. Also, there's something about Gendry running which makes no sense in terms of timeline, because how could he get to the Wall and have a raven fly to Dragonstone so quickly? Anyway, after waiting for a while the Hound throws a rock, which makes a horde of wights charge towards them. This makes absolutely no sense; why would the wights even wait in the first place, since it seems like there was an unbroken patch of ice through which they could have traveled. But it happens nonetheless, of course, because movie, and we then get a very boring, uninspired action sequence. No interesting set is put into place(as in Blackwater), we get no interesting cinematography or scores to aid an otherwise typical battle concept (as in BotB), there is no element of surprise(as in Hardhome), no characters we give half a fuck about die(as in Watchers on the Wall), because D&D have no balls, and there is absolutely no tension whatsoever (as in any other GoT battle). Mundanely shot and conceived hand-to-hand combat, just like that which we have seen thousands of times before, results in a very poor battle, even if the show so desperately wants us to believe that it is an event of monumental proportions. After a few minutes of this, Daenerys arrives on dragon and kills an army of wights and rescues the gang, except for Jon, who stays for no reason whatsoever. Seriously, his motivations are not explained at all. Even though I'm pretty angry at this segment, we do end up getting one very pleasing plot development: the death of Viseron. Granted, it was fairly obvious that they would kill the one dragon named after a distasteful character, and I would much rather it have been Rhaegal or even Drogon, but the possibility of the Night King with a dragon really makes me anticipate the coming season. After this, Benjen comes to rescue Jon, we get a cringy line of dialogue ("Benjen? How?"), which should have been replaced by a facial expression conveying shock, and Benjen dies. We're supposed to think the showrunners are willing to kill off characters because of this, but let's all consider how much we cared about Benjen; he got next to no screen time and had very little importance to the overall plot. Fuck you, D&D.Jon ends up arriving at the Wall (How? Wasn't there a giant wight army that had just killed Benjen only a little bit behind him? Did that not pose any issue?) and he makes an alliance with Daenerys, who ends up figuring out about his scars, but nothing comes of it, and they end up talking about her name instead. Cringy dialogue. The Night King resurrects Viserion (gee, I didn't see that coming) and the episode just ends there. Fuck this show.The main problem for me with this episode was that it relies solely on the fact that it contains a big budget battle rather than good writing or plot development. Every GoT battle is effectively just a dick-measuring contest now: which one showcases more CGI or has the most live horses? In the past, the showrunners have gotten away with this, with the battles gradually losing emotional impact and overall tension, but this is teh breaking point. We're given so little change in this episode, so little to give a fuck about, that all the CGI and blood splatters are revealed for the dick measuring contest they are. The worst part is that D&D won't learn from this: if this episode gets enough praise from the fanbase, D&D's gut reaction will just be to make another of these gigantic action sequences next season one which will somehow be forced to top this mess.To conclude, Arya and Sansa's plot is left very unresolved, Daenerys and Tyrion's dynamic remains unchanged, and the Night King is only slightly closer to knocking down the Wall. Even though the episode tries to convince you that it is dark, no one of importance, or even anyone we really care about, dies, there is no tension in the battle scenes, and none of the thoroughly set up negative changes to relationships, which could have an emotional impact on the audience, come to fruition. How much changed, overall? The Wall is still up, everyone is still alive, and no major political or strategic gains have been made by any of the houses warring for the throne. I have similar feelings for the season as a whole, to be honest, and it's staring to look like the only major development in the season will occur at the very end at which point the Wall will likely come tumbling down. The only bright side is that this episode had so little dynamic change that D&D aren't permanently handicapped by its flaws. In the end, I give the episode a 4/10.(Note: I watched this episode with incredibly poor audio and video quality, so I might consider raising the score when I see a better version. Nonetheless, I really can't see myself giving this episode anything above a 5/10.)
s07e06	It's this simple people: if you dont want to see spoilers don't read and don't throw your “you shouldn't be watching it” at anybody who has watched it. If someone tells me that I'm going to direct them to the South Park episode “Not a Big Deal.” I digress…It was a fun episode to watch and it was visually breathtaking. While I am of the ilk that some things in this episode didn't make sense, I will invoke the MST3K Mantra and go forward bearing in mind it's just a TV show. So pressing on:The first 20 minutes of dialogue among the hunting party was pretty good. Some great moments if comic relief. It was nice to see the ranging party talk to each other. I particularly loved the dialogue between the Hound and Tormuns. I also enjoyed Jon trying to give Longclaw back to jorah who in turn implied it belongs to him and his future generation (was he implying it would be with Dany?) While it may feel fan-servicey to have all these badass characters together and talking, I ate it all up.I don't like the Winterfell plot. Not because Arya and Sansa are bickering, but because it feels like there was nothing to do with Littlefinger's character so they just made him try to run a power play in the North. It seems like LF is just sitting around waiting to die.The Dany-Tyrion conversation was interesting. To start, her coy shyness when Tyrion said Jon's in love with Dany. She deflected like anyone else with a crush normally does. Then taking the conversation to Cersei, my least favorite parts of Dany began to show. Some arrogance and entitlement seemed abound. While she's not wrong, I don't think Tyrion is wrong either. She needs to start preparing for the what happens if she wins the throne.I'm sorry but the polar bear was cool.I liked how the tension ratcheted itself up after the first fight with the white walker party. Once they reached the rock in the middle of the lake my heart was racing. But I also loved how the fight didn't break out immediately. That slow breath before the plunge was spot on if you ask me.I'm assuming that Gendry can partake in any decathalon he wants. He can row, he can run, he can swing a hammer. Not bad.Thoros' death was rather touching, but was immediately proceeded by…The most fan-servicey fight. Which was amazing. I concede that the shot for shot action of each of the characters was a little cheesy, but man was it fun to watch.Dany’s arrival felt a little like deus ex Machina but still it was amazing to witness the fight between dragons and the white walker. Did anyone else notice Dany’s smile when she reach for Jon's hand?I know Viserion's deaths was supposed to be sad, but I can't lie I was ready for it. A dragon had to die eventually.Benjen deserved a better bow out.I don't know what to make of the final scene with Dany and Jon. Dany saw Jon's scars so that will be an interesting conversation now that she knows it wasn't a figure of speech. Hand holding and held gazes aside, I found it odd that Dany received Jon's fealty but it almost seemed like she didn't want it. Maybe Dany respects Jon's position at KitN, or maybe she would rather have Jon at her side as King more than as her Warden of the North. Maybe I'm overanalyzing but it seemed the last scene they both wanted to say something but couldn't get it out.The Night King has a new mount and Westeros is now screwed!Great episode. Probably will end up in the top 10-15 episodes consistently. It might have been too fan-servicey for some, but I loved every second of it.
s07e06	What is your review of Game of Thrones S7E6? (Beyond the Wall)This is the 33rd answer on this thread and I suppose the spoilers may not really matter. This is what I think of this episode “It is one of the worst episodes I have seen. There was only ONE chilling moment, which I will mention later”. The rest was trashy.So Jon Snow, after all that independence and ‘I will not bend the knee’ suddenly decides that Dany (eew) is THE REAL THING? And to set it up they had to have Tormund make a disparaging comment about Mance’s ego not letting him bend the knee resulting in deaths of thousands. In one fell swoop ruining three characters. And why does Jon get this epiphany? Because Dany saves his arse? Which brings me to the next pointThe plot to go and capture a wight is so lame that it befuddles me completely. And for the best individual warriors to go on this mission is worse than stupid. What did they expect would happen? That they would shop for a wight and put it in a cart home? The only thing we learnt that killing a whitewalker destroys the wights that he has created. That is a pointer to how this MAY end - killing the Night’s King could be the answer.I think the show-writers gave a long contract to Aidan Gillen. That must be the only reason for the crap that happened at Winterfell. Sansa suddenly takes advise from the man of whom she had said not long ago “Only a fool would trust LittleFinger”. She sends away the ONLY person who is absolutely devoted to her on a fool’s mission. Expecting Brienne to represent the North in political discussions in Kings Landing? WTF!!!!! I think it is a move to show LittleFinger’s control over Sansa and to pave the way for Brienne to meet Jamie off a battlefield. Whatever, it sucks.Gendry, the lad who has never been anywhere North, suddenly knows the way in a featureless landscape and can run all the way to Eastwatch by the sea! Pull the other one.Jon, who knows that Valyrian steel kills the White Walkers, offers to give up his sword on the eve of battle! What the f*** were you thinking Jon.Benjen Stark, the perennial deux ex machina. Lived only to save Bran and Jon. SighThen that sick romance between Jon and Daenerys. More than ridiculous and goes against all that character development that has happened over the last six seasons. Flipping soap opera material.I shall stop with that one brilliant moment - the Night’s King has caught up in the arms race :)The whole silly plot after the brilliant build up merely underscores the point that the brilliance of GRR Martin is far far superior to that of the show-writers who are all at sea on the plot front.
s07e06	“The rules are wrong.” Arya Stark from “Beyond the Wall”.“Death is the enemy.” Beric Dondarrion from “Beyond the Wall.“ How many of his people died for his pride?” Tormund from “Beyond the Wall”.I watched the episode last night and this morning (Sunday night and Monday morning). As an episode unto itself, I would give it a six out of ten. Yes, it was cinematically beautiful. The costumes were great. The music worked, as it always does. The scenes of the Army of the Dead were spectacular, and all subsequent fights were equally brilliant. This is where the showrunners shine. I loved watching the cold lands beyond the wall, and I admit my favorite part of the Westeros continent is what lies past the jurisdiction of the monarch—the lands of ice and the shivering sea. Much was very good in the episode, but in terms of the story itself, it left me feeling a bit empty.Arya and Sansa (Lady Macbeth vs. Lady Macbeth) I can believe that Arya has lost much of her humanity by turning into a killing machine. I don’t see that as a product of her Faceless Man training, which was another symptom of a deeper problem: Arya’s PTSD. Arya was present when her father died and whisked into the wild, changing herself into a boy—the first of many “faces” she needed to don in order to survive. Now she is back at Winterfell as Arya Stark and she doesn’t know who that person is. We see her looking at places outside, remembering her father and her tomboyish ways, as though she is trying to rationalize how she became a deathly killer. I don’t know if the show intends this, but I see an Arya who is falling apart at the seams. She has lost her confidence. She only knows how to kill now, so she is looking at her sister as a possible enemy, courtesy of Littlefinger’s meddling. It is as he knew the confusion Arya would feel, and decided to make her think she is clear headed. Anger does that to people: they think they are rational when they are not.The question here is Sansa: what does she think of Arya’s musings and accusations? Arya tells her of the scroll, and Sansa doesn’t deny it, but tries to explain it. A more grounded Arya would accept her explanation as reasonable, as Sansa was a prisoner of the Lannisters—the play in Braavos confirmed it, plus Robb was not influenced at all by the letter: he knew she was pressured to write what Cersei wanted, and never faulted Sansa. Has Arya forgotten what it is like to be afraid? Does Arya forget what it means to be a prisoner? That is exactly what she was at Harranhal, with the Hound, and later in her time with the Faceless Man cult. But this Arya cannot hear the suffering in Sansa’s voice: she assumes Sansa betrayed her family because she acted like a girl: she liked nice clothes, knitting and wanted to be with her perfect prince. Arya hated the rules of feminine behavior and rebelled effectively against them once the crisis hit the Starks. Trained by Syrio, she knew the footwork for swordfighting, and later she learned to use her wits to take down adversaries—the Hound really was her best teacher for that. The faceless man cult taught her to be unseen, so she perfected her craft.Arya cannot hear Sansa because she is flashing back to the girl she was before life fell apart. She despised her sister, and the ill will was heartily returned. Sansa was a twit in those days, and she is now the first to admit it. But Arya cannot go beyond her younger days when her sister was her greatest rival. Now she is projecting all her rage about her suffering by making Sansa the cause.I know a lot of people don’t buy this part of the story, but I see why it works. Litterfinger triggered Arya. He used her trauma to help his cause. If I didn’t hate Littlefinger before (he just annoyed me), I certainly do now.So we have to see if Sansa is trapped in the past, or has she moved on. She sends Brienne away, when Littlefinger seemed to suggest that Brienne could help to solve the problem between the two girls she swore to protect. I found that fascinating. Did Sansa do that to protect Brienne from breaking her vow? If she kills Arya, she breaks her vow as she needs to protect both girls. If she displeases Sansa, she could be dismissed and Arya might go with her, effectively breaking the Stark power. Is Sansa thinking like a political player who understands the discipline of realpolitik thinking? Does she know that Littlefinger has set them both up? Yes, Sansa says unkind things like: I won the Battle of The Bastards, not Jon. I got the Knights of the Vale to come. Yes, it is unpleasant, but it isn’t wrong. Jon admits it. It was one of Sansa’s smartest moves as she played Littlefinger to do her bidding, plus deliberately didn’t tell Jon in the hope that he would forgive her. She knew Jon was too proud to accept any more help, as most of the Northern lords turned their backs on him. So she did win the war for him, and they have made their peace with it.I will predict that Sansa senses Littlefinger’s hand in this quandary. Bran will confirm it. We didn’t see Bran this episode as he may be watching the White Walker fight in his visions. I think both siblings will wake Arya out of her delusions and perhaps make her realize that she is truly home with two loving siblings. Arya may even cry about the past, then feel terrible for distrusting her sister. I expect Littlefinger to exit left or be killed. Really, the story doesn’t need him anymore, and better characters have died because the show decided they were unwelcome, so it would be fan pleasing to kill him, or just let him go so us fans who think all too much about this series will wonder if he will come back in Season 8. I bet this one ends with a cliffhanger concerning Littlefinger.Dragonstone (Break the Wheel) I don’t have much to say as I found it to be an odd scene. Tyrion is trying to do his job as Hand, which is to counsel the Queen. Dany moves from a rational listener to annoyed to downright angry. What did Tyrion do that was so terrible? He told her the truth about her emotions. He didn’t see why both Tarly men had to die, citing Dickon as the one who should have lived. (Interesting: if I were playing the Game of Thrones, I would kill Dickon in front of Randyll’s eyes if I wanted him to bend the knee or suffer.) Daenerys is clearly wrestling with feelings she doesn’t want to have. She laments the mission of Jon Snow, talking about warriors like Drogo and Daario. Tyrion caught the reference, saying these were men she loved. Of course this begs the question, do you love Jon Snow? Is this why you are doing this asinine mission? No, yes, no—leave me alone- is perhaps what Daenerys wants to say as she doesn’t want to love Jon Snow, nor does she want to admit that love influences her political decisions.Tyrion wants her to see how emotions affect her judgment, and she doesn’t want to hear it. He reminds her of her vision of a new world, her choice to “break the wheel.” And this is where I got confused, as I am an American and just dealt with a crazy election that still feels ongoing with constant speechifying. What is the vision of Daenerys Targaryen? What wheel does she want to break? Is she calling for a revolution? Does she want to destroy the landed gentry and make House Whatever no long part of the ruling class? Does she want to give the poor rights that they never had? Is she(gasp) a Socialist? Who are the slaves that she wants to free in Westeros? What is her vision? The fact that I really don’t know may not be the show’s fault. It may be their point. Tyrion needs to believe that Daenerys is worth his time because he has lost so much and she is all he has. He wants to believe his life has meaning. So maybe, just maybe, he has created a Daenerys in his own image that she cannot be. It is far easier to tear away existing institutions and social structures than it is to rebuild.The desperation in Tyrion’s voice made me sad for him, but also annoyed in general. Did Dany woo him with promises? Not really, other than “break the wheel” and “Westeros is mine” and “ my rights” and “ I will not have slavery”, etc. However, Daenerys has always been good at getting followers, not through her words, but her deeds (freeing the slaves at Astapor, killing the Khals, riding Drogon). She is spectacular to view, and that is part of her appeal. But I was reminded of Aragorn’s words to Eowyn in the movie version of The Return of the King: “It is but a shadow and a thought that you love. I cannot give you what you seek.” Daenerys cannot utter those words as she still believes she can give him what he seeks, even though she hasn’t figured out what that is. I expect that will be a problem for both of them.Army of the Dead (Deux ex Machina) This was the best televised part of the episode, but the least satisfying for me in terms of story. We learn a few things about the wights and the White Walkers: once you kill a White Walker, a good portion of wights die. The show wants us to realize that, as this information will be valuable in the war to come. I have to ask: does that include animals as well. I’m sure those of you who know the episode know why I ask.This is the most troubling part of the episode as it is really is well done cinematically, and breathtaking to watch. The sceneary is amazing. The dialogue is among the best I’ve heard all season, such as Gendry’s roasting when he complained about his legitimate feelings of anger at getting sold to Melisandre. The Hound and Tormund got the best lines as usual, but Beric and Thoros were no slackers as Thoros doesn’t see his deeds in the battle as particularly glorious (I was the drunkest), and Beric (the enemy always wins). Jon offers Jorah Longclaw, and he refuses, saying he isn’t worthy and he will honor his father’s wishes. The Hound and Tormund don’t seem to get along, so it was no surprise to me that the Hound saves Tormund (I love Tormund Giantsbane), so the Hound may have won a new friend. I bet they will meet in battle again.However, the premise to go beyond the wall is so dang stupid. They are there to catch a wight to prove to the queens (the one with the dragons and the one f&*&ing her brother) that the threat is real. Of course, they catch him right away, but the battle has only begun. That was amazing staging with the island of ice surrounded by the Army of the Dead. Fantastic. But you also know that they will get out and here are some of my problems:Among Star Trek fans, we have a phrase called “red shirts”. They are the guys sent on a mission with Captain Kirk, Spock and Dr. McCoy who have no names, no dialogue and exist to be killed by the alien or whatever bad guy the crew faces. I counted 4 red shirts in the episode who died from the wights. Were they eaten alive? (I watch the Walking Dead and I swear it looked like a zombie feast at times.) Who were these guys? It doesn’t matter. They are there to thrill you with the might of the enemy.They almost killed Tormund. Okay, I love that guy and want him to live, but the Game of Thrones of earlier seasons would have killed him to show there is no plot armor in this universe. He survives, and now we know that the show is going to protect certain characters until the last minute.Jon showed very poor judgment. Yeah, I said that. Somehow Gendry makes it back to Davos even though the guy admits he has never seen snow before, so Tormund gives him solid advice on how to beat the cold—he, ah, believes in movement. Of course, Gendry collapses in front of the Wall. Of course, the dragons get there in nanoseconds and of course the dragons kick major ass—killing wights by the hundreds if not more. (Deux ex Machina 1) Does Jon make it onto the dragon when everyone else is ready to go? No, he has things to do, so of course he is going to face death again—remember Battle of the Bastards? Of course, he will survive against unbelievable odds, and now we see why Uncle Benjen left the Wall. It was to save Bran and Jon. Yep. Coldhands Benjen is Deux ex Machina 2, and really, he deserved better. So we get a repeat of Jon surviving the Wildlings, and coming back to the Wall, injured, but alive. I don’t need spoilers to call that one. Jon’s need to be the hero may be his undoing.I sensed the Night King was going to off a dragon and his bolt is better than the Scorpion Bolt from the Lannisters. The Night King was impressive: he almost was happy to see these dragons as he knew one would be his. I bet he could have killed all 3 if he wanted, but this is the show, so he needs one to make into—you got it—an wight dragon that breathes ice. I bet that will be his new ride.Edit: I just read an answer about the Night King by Kelsey L. Hayes : I agree: I think the Night King expected the dragons, deliberately chose Viserion and possibly rigged the entire situation to get his dragon. Hyperlinks to her answer are forthcoming.I won’t say much about the boat business except that the romance is going to happen, and Jon just bent the knee, which may become moot, once Dany finds out he is her, ah, nephew, with a better claim to the throne than she has. How will the North feel about submitting to a Targaryen, particularly the daughter of the Mad King who killed Rickard Stark and his heir, Brandon Stark? Will the show have Jon and Dany versus the Night King with Jon mounting Rhaegal? I will say yes. I don’t think we will see that in the books, but it doesn’t really matter right now. The show got their ice dragon and the line has been drawn. The wight business was not done for Cersei who will not give a toss about the White Walkers. It was done so that the showrunners could end the story. It was a decent episode, and exciting to watch, but the story is just not very believable. And yes, I know this is fantasy, but fantasy works when we can relate it to our lives. With that in mind, only the Stark situation and Tyrion’s reaction felt genuine to me. The rest was good television.
s07e06	It was, sadly, pretty bad.Visually there was a lot to like, and the awakening of the dead dragon was a great moment, but the writing has simply failed at this point.The Sisters. I’m not sure I believe Petyr is more clever than Arya, especially given that although he might appreciate her water dancing it seems unlikely he appreciates the depth of her training. And I just don’t find the interaction between the sisters convincing or genuine, and the dagger scene left me feeling like there was supposed to be a message but they forgot to deliver it (the dagger in general has been a distraction past due for explanation the entire season).Time and Teleportation. I think everyone is a little irritated with the timeline being so unbelievable.The Dream Team. Well, if we are going to teleport, I guess we should just go all Trek and make the redshirts super obvious. I don’t think we even saw any of their faces - were they just CGI? Forced dialog, the Jorah/Jon sword thing didn’t seem genuine, very predictable, and ultimately disappointing that Thoros was the only “real” person to die. Polar bear kind of pointless, perhaps Thoros (as the group’s healer) was the target of that attack? Would have been a perfect time for Donderrion to die. Jon being left behind - very forced, and did anyone really believe he was going to die? BIG complaint - why no horses? Who would take a time sensitive trip over a long distance with the intent of picking up a bulky package on foot? And with no supplies (not even backpacks)? Has the writing gotten so predictable that even the characters know what is going to happen? Oh, and let’s not take any ravens with us either.The Mission from (a Red) God. Let’s pretend that a wight is really necessary to unite the factions. How did they see this going down, especially without horses? Walk in the general direction with limited scouting ability and hope that rather than running into a giant wight army and MOUNTED Others that you stumble into a small group or single wight (convenient how there was just one that had not been turned by the Other they were with, maybe too convenient), catch him and carry him all the way back on foot. Yeah, that should work. You know what might be really a useful addition to the team? If only Ghost wasn’t stuck in that rowboat….SOOO Predictable. Every single plot point in this episode was entirely predictable.Ice-On / Ice-Off. We are going to surround these guys and wait for the dragon to arrive because that is our real objective, so it is ok when our wights can’t cross the broken ice and get to the bait, and we won’t use our ability to freeze the lake and let them pass because we want our bait alive and fresh, but then when the lake freezes we will let our troops go ahead and cross and kill the bait. Boy, it sure is a good thing that blonde has impeccable timing, or we would have ruined our own ambush!Benjen “Coldhands” Stark. Wasted scene, wasted character, unsatisfying story arc. And how did Jon even make it out of the water to start with?Eeny Meany Miny Mo. Should I spear the leader sitting right in front of me, or try a much harder target flying above. I do have multiple spears, so it would kind of make sense to get the close easy one, which would also cause their mission to fail, then maybe I could get another as it came in to try and help its brother…. or I could just head fake that way and show off my mad javelin skills and throw at the one flying…. (Insert fake tension here) Why couldn’t V have been hit diving in to take the hit for his “family”? Would have made more sense, been more plausible, and allowed a more tragic aspect to his fate. I know, I know - if we don’t kill the one that might fall in the water, what are we going to do with all these big chains that we carried all the way south (is that why their army has been moving so slow?)?I hate to ask GRRM to do ANYTHING other than finish the WoW, but maybe he could spare just a week and help D&D remember what writing looks like?
s07e06	The dialogue among the members of the Suicide Squad was great.Everything else? They sucked.What the hell are they trying to do with Sansa and Arya? I’m trying to think of how the writers may be pulling one on us because I just can’t accept that after all this time, Sansa and Arya are still being played by Littlefinger. Arya’s training as a Faceless Man would be useless if she isn’t onto LF’s scheme. Sansa’s training as a Lady would also be useless if she’s still trusting LF. And where the hell is Bran to at least clarify things between his sisters? They introduce him as this all-knowing, all-seeing demigod, and yet he’s conveniently out of the picture when Arya and Sansa discuss what happened to them in King’s Landing? Everything about this whole Sansa vs Arya thing goes against what I was expecting about the Starks this season- that they would band together and, as cliche as it may sound, defeat all those who did their family wrong. What was the point of including Sansa’s comment, “When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives” in the trailer for season 6 if they’re gonna squabble between the two of them just like they did in season 1?And that whole island on ice thing was just so. fucking. contrived. Once they got themselves trapped there, surrounded by the wights, it could ONLY GO ONE DIRECTION- that Daenerys saves their asses on dragonback. I’ve already ignored the obvious time and distance inconsistencies they’ve introduced, but this one just really takes the cake of being predictable AF besides already being very stupid. How can Gendry run back to Eastwatch when it’s his first time to be north of the Wall? When was is it established that he’s the fastest? What was the point of disarming him? How were they able to survive the night without freezing to death? If the Night King was an Olympian javelin thrower, why didn’t he just kill the Suicide Squad who would have been easy pickings since they were stationary? Why the fuck did Dany not identify who the leaders are and fire on them? WHERE THE HELL DID THEY GET THOSE BIG-ASS CHAINS, AND HOW DID THE WIGHTS DIVE WHEN IT’S BEEN ESTABLISHED THEY CAN’T GO IN WATER?Other details that pissed me off include the whole in-your-face repetition that Jon doesn’t look like Ned and must’ve taken after his mom- YES THEY’RE FORESHADOWING THE REVEAL OF JON’S REAL PARENTAGE. We get that. Also, it pisses me to no end that they keep on instigating that it’s Jon who ‘loves’ Dany- uh, nope, he doesn’t look like it and in fact it’s Daenerys who has fallen in love with him. AND. OH MY GOD. That whole thing about Tormund repeating the pride thing being the only reason which kept Mance/ Jon from bending the knee is also so freaking obvious- and JON DID BEND THE KNEE! Why?! Daenerys already believed him and just said that she’d support the North in the war against the White Walkers, and they still made Jon bend the knee. What is the point?! Female power? Gahh.Finally, the show-runners, for all their foreshadowing about Jon’s real identity, missed the glorious chance of having Rhaegal stay behind and be the one to save Jon’s ass. Rhaegal, the dragon named for Rhaegar, Jon’s father. Instead, they chose to give like a five-second deus ex machina 2.0 screen time to Benjen Stark and HAVE HIM KILLED RIGHT AFTER. What.I have accepted that the quality of the show would decline because David Benioff and DB Weiss have run out of original GRRM material to adapt, and I’ve seen what they could do when they do their own take on an arc (that whole Dorne stuff sucked balls). But the stupidity of the whole Sansa vs Arya arc and the predictability of the rescue mission is hard to swallow. Right now I really wish GRRM would come out with book 6 because I desperately want my good story back.
s07e06	Major Spoilers for Season 7 Episode 6:Game of Thrones is back to firing on all cylinders. Great, character building dialogue, fantastic acting, moral conundrums and kick-ass battle scenes that manage to top most other scenes in the series — a tall order.First of all I enjoyed all the scenes: other than the battle scenes, this was very much an episode made up of two-person scenes: the kind of two person scenes that Game of Thrones used to excel in: remember the Cersei/Robert scenes of season 1 or the Arya/Tywin scenes or Tyrion/Cersei scenes of Season 2? Quality dialogue that deepens and enriches the characters and manages to advance the plot at the same time. It’s great to see the disparate members of Jon Snow’s Fellowship of the Abduction, heading north to pick up a spare wight, talking together: these colorful, memorable characters — especially Tormund and the Hound— together makes for a gold mine of entertaining and genuinely funny dialogue.And the scenery — shot in Iceland I presume — is just gorgeously shot.But it’s not just the quester’s interaction: it’s also Tyrion and Dany — genuinely playing out through dialogue the same debates on the moral choices that Daenerys has made that has ignited the fandom. You do get the sense that Tyrion’s points are taken; Dany is growing and learning, even as she stands her ground and rightly calls Tyrion out for the flaws in his stewardship.It presents her conundrum perfectly: how do you conquer a kingdom without horrible bloodshed? And how do you plan for the time afterwards — when you’ve pledged to revolutionize society? Tyrion argues for Democracy. Is that where it’s headed? I can’t think that a society as medieval as Game of Throne is not quite ready for that big step.And Arya and Sansa’s (and Sansa - Littlefinger and Sansa - Brienne) scenes also resonated with me. Last week I was sort of annoyed at Arya’s political thickness; but this week I realized that it really is true to their characters: they don’t get along. They are fundamentally different. They grew up fighting and it’s actually utterly plausible that the extremist Arya, put through fire and hell would react so negatively to Sansa, whose own experiences have wrought her into what she is. The politician and the assassin: they can work together, but can they really like each other? But in the final scene, when Arya gives the hilt back to Sansa after what was clearly and obviously a very strong threat means that Arya is giving Sansa a chance: the ball is in her court. Maybe Sansa can order a hit on Arya (though seeing how badass she was in episode 3, I’d think twice about it); but will she? I don’t think she will. I think this is the source of Sansa’s conundrum. But Sansa, knowing that the Northerners can’t be trusted (bloody weathervanes) is going to do the politically most astute move: and that is make alliance with her sister. When Littlefinger tells he doesn’t know where Arya found the raven-message, we know he is lying. When Sansa finds out, I still think Littlefinger is doomed. I will be shocked if turns out otherwise: with either Sansa or Arya dying. This is Game of Thrones and shocking things do happen: but I doubt if that is going to happen.Of course Dany and Jon get a little closer together: their chemistry is referenced in the Dany - Tyrion scene and the penultimate scene between the King in the North and the Mother of Dragons is the most nakedly emotional, simple and honest scene — without the usual juvenile semi-hipster-ish post-modern cynicism that bugs me so much so often — that I think the show has ever done. And I bought it. I totally bought it.Of course the Quest was always doomed to get into trouble — I still think the plan was utterly stupid — but what a fantastic set of scenes it was! The Bear felt a bit like expensive filler, but the rest of the various battles wiht the Dead was gripping stuff. And we found out that killing White Walkers kills his own personal minions off, which does a little to level the playing field, I guess. Thoros and the redshirts bit the dust but I am surprised that the rest got off unscathed…Game of Thrones has gotten a bit conventional in not killing off the big names here at the beginning of the endgame, using the usual cliches of faking characters’ death implausibly…but the cliches in this episode were all done so freshly that I didn’t really mind. Even if Jon Snow got his umpteenth fake death/resurrection. Does anybody really think he is not going to last to the end of this series?I must say the dragon-White Walker showdown is something that viewers have been waiting a long time to see: and it delivered in spades. And we see now that Qyburn’s arrows and Bronn’s scorpion bolts were foreshadowing of the Night King’s javelin of ice. But actually, the death of the Viserion and subsequent wightification of going to be a shocker for a lot of casual fans who make up the majority of viewers. The dragons are frighteningly effective against the highly flammable wights and White Walkers — but no longer can we expect Dany to just waltz north and wipe them out. Which is a bit of a relief: because that, while drawing some cheers from the audience would ultimately be a dramatic let-down in this show whose name was made by not doing the expected.Now, I am a nit-picker and there were some nits that I definitely could pick. Of course the distances are now so absurdly small that even casual viewers like my wife are noticing it. I still think the plot of "capture the wight!” was the stupidest idea that I have ever heard. Laughably bad idea! But with writing and characterization so good — and while I enjoy bitching about the show runners, they really rocked this episode: fine writing all around, an enviable accomplishment — and visual effects so stunning, I really don’t care. I feel like I felt in early seasons: sure it was different from the books but it was still good.Speaking of the books: There are going to be a lot of book series fans, who mistake grey for black, who are going to pissed off about the episode: as a book-obsessed fan, myself, I could probably list 20 things about this episode that actually can not play out this way in the books. Fan service, blah, blah, blah. But it all felt so right to me, in a dramatic sense. Even — no, especially — the Jon-Dany scene near the end. I wasn’t sure I wanted that: but when I saw it, I realized I did want that.  That is the way the story is going: the books might be different. But I don’t think they will be so different, insofar as character and their interactions are concerned: Dany is a grey character, not a black villain. A dangerous force, not an evil baddie. Even though I still cling to my hopeful theory that Jon will be forced to kill the dragons and her for the sake of the world: just because I feel that that might be the most tragic and heartbreaking end — and the one that most echoes the “bittersweet” LOTR-style ending that Martin claims to be aiming for. We’ll see next year. Or perhaps 2019. Hope I’m still around!Even if they are completely different stories though, the showmakers are managing to sell me on their version of the story, implausible, cocked up and silly as it sometimes is. At it’s best it is the human drama that makes or breaks the show. Though the dragons are nice, too.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall made me feel like I wasn’t watching Game of Thrones anymore.I remember the days when people were shocked by Ned’s execution. Then the Red Wedding happened and Oberyn lost his duel. Heck, even the main protagonist of the series, Jon, wasn’t safe. It was thrilling to watch each new episode because you never knew what might happen. No one was safe. While the show writers sometimes overdid it and went for cheap shock value, the finale of the last season made me feel hopeful again (Sept of Baelor, with that beautiful piano music).Yet, as I watched Jon and his six companions walk out through the gate of Eastwatch, I wasn’t worried. There was no tension. I had a suspicion that Thoros might die and maybe Beric too, but I was pretty damn sure that everybody else was safe. And it turned out that I was right.The show has become very predictable at this point. Jorah was cured of greyscale (I still don’t know why that entire plot was necessary), so we know that he is safe until the end of season 8 or so. Gendry was recently reintroduced and they keep hammering down (pun intended) that he’s Robert’s bastard, so it seems very likely that he will survive the series, inherit Storm’s End and probably marry either Arya or Sansa. Jon has more plot armor than everyone else combined so we never have to feel worried about him either.I feel like, in the Game of Thrones that I once knew, they wouldn’t have come off so lightly. If we were back in one of the early seasons, then at the very least, some characters would’ve suffered from severe frostbite. Gendry would’ve lost an ear or two and some fingers. Jorah, who everyone expected to have some larger purpose because he just survived greyscale, would die by sacrificing himself so the others can escape. I would also have Jon suffer from some kind of setback, for example by losing Longclaw (and then he could get Heartsbane from Sam, now I really wish this would have happened!).Apart from this lack of any dramatic tension and consequences (Viserion doesn’t count, that was probably the whole reason why the show writers created this capture-a-wight mission to begin with and very predictable), the episode was just so full of plot holes that I was honestly surprised. It’s a fantasy show so there’s a lot I am willing to overlook for the sake of good television, but I don’t think we’ve seen this many holes before. Off the top of my head:Gendry has never seen snow before, but somehow he is a better choice to run back to Eastwatch than Tormund? You know, the guy who’s lived in this area his entire life.The NK’s army is so close to Eastwatch that an attack is imminent (Gendry could run that distance), yet Jon & co decide it’s best to leave Eastwatch behind and travel across half the continent to talk to Cersei. Why? She should have no meaningful army left and even if she has, say, 30 thousand men, is that really worth losing the Wall for? At the very least, we should’ve gotten a scene of Jon communicating with Sansa and organizing the defense of the Wall. Make him not look incompetent, for once.Why didn’t they just smash the ice to maintain the moat barrier? They even had Gendry’s hammer with them. Sure, the story demanded that there would be a fight, but this could be solved by having the NK freeze the lake after they smash it.Why did they have Benjen-ex-machina save Jon and where was he all this time? Wouldn’t it make far more sense and be more believable if they had Rhaegal save Jon (and this would further reinforce the point that he is a Targaryen)?Was the wight polar bear really necessary and couldn’t they have given us Ghost instead? Not much of a plothole I admit, but they keep saying it’s either dragons or direwolves when they also spent a lot of CGI budget on other animals or dragon appearances that don’t add much to the plot. If there was ever a moment where Ghost would really come in handy, it would be on this mission.A lot has already been said on this and now even the director of this episode admitted that it was a mistake.[1]But the in-universe timescale makes no sense if Daenerys starts her rescue mission all the way from Dragonstone. That’s at least 2000+ kilometres from Eastwatch (some estimate it at 2500 km), which would take a raven about 2 days. In the interview, the director said that he hopes the ‘momentum of the show carries over some of that stuff’ and that ‘we were aware that timing was getting a little hazy’. That sort of stuff is fine when it’s just a teleporting Littlefinger that we’re talking about, but not when the entire plot and rescue scene depends on it. It breaks the immersion. The director also admitted that they meant for Jon & co to spend one night on the island so that means it’s all just a big mess.During the scenes between Arya and Sansa, it is conveniently forgotten that Arya spent some time serving Tywin as his cupbearer (was that also ‘betraying her family’?) and that this is how Arya witnessed Sansa’s reaction during Ned’s execution scene (and how she remembers it in the books):So, in other words, the entire forced drama between Arya and Sansa over that letter and Sansa’s behavior in King’s Landing makes no sense whatsoever. Everyone in the books who read that letter (Robb, Catelyn, even Bran) didn’t take it seriously and saw it as Cersei’s words, not Sansa’s. Some people are saying Sansa and Arya are faking it all to deceive Littlefinger, but unless he planted microphones all over Winterfell, that would make her threats and game of faces way too excessive. It all just feels like filler to give Sansa and Arya something to do and delay Littlefinger’s inevitable end.Jon offers Longclaw to Jorah even though Lyanna Mormont is the rightful heir, so why did he never offer it to her? And why offer it to Jorah halfway through your expedition when you might need it later to, oh I don’t know, kill a white walker?When that white walker is killed, all the wights drop dead, except for one. Quite convenient.Why didn’t they bring any horses or ravens on their expedition?How did the NK attach those chains to Viserion? Where did he get those chains from, anyway? I guess you could say he got them from Hardhome and knew he might need them due to his greenseer powers, but that’s a lot of handwaving.All in all, a pretty disappointing episode, with little to no dramatic tension and a lot of plotholes and timescale issues that broke the immersion for me. The visuals, costumes and actors are still top-notch but it’s not enough to compensate for the writing.Footnotes[1] ‘Game of Thrones’ Director Alan Taylor Breaks Down Timeline in ‘Beyond the Wall’
s07e06	It was enraging. It was awesome to watch, but it had gigantic gaping holes in its story that leaves the viewer with a sense of confusion and dissatisfaction.HumansJon Snow is not impervious to death. Neither is he stupid. In fact, he’s one of the most practical characters on the show. So what was his reasoning to go out with less than 20 men to not only fight off the Night King and his humungous army, but to also capture a wight and bring it back to King’s Landing? Seriously, what was the plan for this suicidal mission? Or is he in the category of “what is dead may never die?” ala Harry’s sacrifice keeping everyone safe from Death Eaters’ curses during the final battle in the Great Hall? He kept getting magically saved in that wonderful long take scene in Battle of the Bastards, and he kept getting saved here too. The wights actually looked like they waited to attack him again after he stood watching Viserion fall.Deus ex machina in the form of dragons (warranted, as one had to die) and — uh Benjen Stark? He had his sling of fire, why didn’t he get up on the horse and go too? He could have killed a maximum of 50, maybe 100 wights? Why sacrifice him?A lot of people seem to be complaining about how GoT has lost its novelty because it isn’t killing primary characters anymore. I disagree here. A story is always about a few core people, so all the sidekicks have sidekicked the bucket and the central ones remain. That’s what they show’s been building for all of past seasons. Which is of course why we knew Jon wasn’t really dead. However, why is Beric Dondarrion still alive? I figured he was needed as a source of fire after Thoros of Myr died, but how and why did he survive the battle? Tormund is needed for the Wildling alliance and Hound is needed for Cleganebowl, but how come only unknown characters and Thoros of Myr killed when there were easily a thousand wights surrounding a paltry 7+ men?What’s Dany wearing? She’s flying at top speed atop a dragon and is beyond the Wall. Not only is it cold there, it is White Walker cold. The show has implied that she might be resistant to fire, but she sure as hell isn’t resistant to cold, is she?Jon was pushed into the water by two wights and we see him “drowning” with no wights around. How did he come back up without them? Did he fight them off or do the wights not swim? There were hundreds of them in the water already, so if they can swim, they would have swam out. If they could swim, the unfrozen lake would not have been an impediment, they would have all crossed it. The only conclusion I can draw is that wights can’t swim.Dragons and White WalkersThe show has definitely gotten incredible with CGI, but it does seem like every time they bring in dragons, they lose the plot. In the previous episode, Dany burnt the train of loot (great) but also the Tarlys (huh)? But she doesn’t want to be a despot, and her struggle is never addressed quite as well as it was in the first few seasons when she starts using her dragons.Then the White Walkers. Yeah, sure the Night King had a perfect aim, but it’s an effing dragon. Dragon hides are ridiculously strong. Literally the only thing that has pierced a dragon hide in the history of ASOIAF universe is another dragon. It is well established (in the books) that the dragon’s weak spot is its eye. If the NK really had to throw a spear, he should have aimed for the eye and have it bust out through the back of the dragon’s head because when you hit the brain, you bring the beast down. If they didn’t want it to be overtly practical, they should at the least have had him throw several spears so that Viserion finally falls. The more we see White Walkers on screen, the less terrified (and more fascinated) we become. So as we learn more about their magic, the show should be making them more understandable; not suddenly over-magic them with superior javelin abilities.When the NK actually threw the spear, you can see he looks over Drogon who’s sitting on the lake to aim at Viserion. Why? Isn’t a sitting dragon a more effective sitting duck? He could have easily killed Drogon and maybe a Targaryen or two in the process.WightsFirst off, the bear got taken out with a dagger, so dragonglass “kills” wights? How did this just get dropped into the show out of the blue? I went back and realized that Jon had mentioned this to Dany before he started mining, but how did he know? AFAIK, this wasn’t in the books or at the Fist of the First Men, so if someone can point out where dragonglass was used against wights successfully, I’d be very grateful.But wait, there’s more. The wights finally stopped crossing the lake when several rows of them kept falling in. But when the Hound’s rock comes to rest, a wight realizes that he can now cross the lake? So wights can think and make decisions beyond just their remnant memory? That really changes things.Then there are the follow up questions to blue eyed Viserion — how did the wights pull him out? Can they swim? If they can, they could have just swam across the lake. What’s the deal here? (Several people here are asking where all the chains came from. I think the scene can be passed off as not happening immediately afterward.)Concepts of time and distanceSo far, in the season, it’s been quite understood that things happening in different geographical locations are not happening simultaneously. There’s no way all those ships could have sailed to Dragonstone without Euron spotting them before he reached King’s Landing, so those two things did not happen simultaneously. But Jon managed to reach Eastwatch-by-the-sea, go out with men far from the Wall, then have Gendry run back and send a raven, have the raven fly all the way to Dragonstone, have Dany fly to where Jon was, all in a matter of hours? Who are you kidding? The distance Dany had to cover was the size of Canada!Overall the episode was highly disappointing to me. But yay for undead Viserion.
s07e06	Just short takes this week:The use of a redshirt in the battle against the wights was clever. It definitely added to the drama. That said, this effect undermined itself by about the second iteration.Filming battle scenes is hard. Watching one of the extras do his best in the background was adorable.I’m disappointed that Jorah made it out alive. Dude has become a caricature of melodrama. Also, his banter game is terrible. He’s worse at it than Gloomy McGloomyface. Chap needs a noble end, and soon.As I said last week, a spin-off of the Snarky Seven just walking about saying mean things to each other would be A+ television. The Hound and Tormund were a delight.The lads going north without a horse between them is the kind of lazy oversight that’s tanking this season (which I feel is unfortunate given how excellent the filmmaking has been).Speaking of ace visuals, the ice bear going all Revenant on Thoros was a feat of special effects. Ditto for making me care about a dying dragon. This is the kind of niche art that only a handful of production companies can pull off. We are blessed.Is it me, or is Jonno kinda terrible at this whole war business? Seems he consistently rushes in against superior forces without a credible plan, then gets annoyed when someone has to save and/or resurrect him.Also, his salvation came far too soon this time around. Not enough of a time gap for any dramatic effect. I mean, his plot armor was thick enough already. But it seems the only point of that scene was finding a way to kill off Benjen and get Jonno back in the buff.I’m not an expert at this whole party raid business, but I feel like if there’s one guy you want to protect, it’s probably the one who can bring others back from the dead. F-.That scene where Tormund almost bit it would have been spectacular had there been a real chance that he was about to be written off. As I said last week, DB and David just don’t have Martin’s killer instinct. I’m no longer afraid, which isn’t a good thing.Same with the Great Sister Feud of Winterfell. Seeing as there’s zero chance of this ending any other way than one of them cutting Littlefinger with his old dagger, the scene basically became a Black Mirror take on Real Housewives.On a related note, either the writers forgot to rewatch Season One or else the girls are both in on an act:So, let me get this right: Jonno is saved by his ice-uncle (who he’s not actually related to) so that he could live to bang his fire-aunt (who he’s definitely related to)? Don’t know how to feel about that.[EDIT: I’m an idiot. 10 points to Alison Hill for pointing out that Benjen is still his uncle via Lyanna.]Unrelated note, some fans have incredible attention to detail:(To see what OP is referring to, see this GIF. It’s definitely a thing.)While I applaud OP’s level of observational powers, it feels like the show is penalizing viewers for paying attention (whereas Martin rewarded it).In general, the post-show thread on Reddit is probably the most entertaining thing I read all week. The analysis is generally meh, but the snark is on point:As I wrote about in relation to the Season One finale of The OA, TV is entering an interesting age where writers have to strike the finest of balances between being too predictable and too gimmicky. This is a really hard thing, especially when you have a fanbase this big swapping their thoughts on centralized discussion platforms.So, while I’d give this season fairly low marks for giving too much away too early, I feel like I’d have a very different take if I steered clear of said forums. (Someone remind me to avoid the internet during Westworld Season Two.)
s07e06	It was shit and I didn’t enjoy it.Before I go on a huge rant, I would like to say that I love Game of Thrones. That is the reason I am typing this right now. I am most critical of the things I love the most so if you’re one of the few who is enjoying season 7, somehow, don’t get on my back for complaining.The lack of tension. I knew Daenerys was going to provide some ex-machina bullshit and save them, and I was right. They run into almost zero problems. Yeah they get stuck on a rock on an ice lake but it’s not like anyone dies. Gendry runs back to Eastwatch without dilemma and sends a raven. What the fuck. Let Gendry get attacked by wights while on his way back and die or something. Then the audience would be like: oh my God, how will they get out of this now. Have Tormund die to let us know that not everyone will survive. And for fuck’s sake don’t just kill all the extras!Tormund and his way out of character dialogue. So Tormund, who is a part of the FREE FOLK, is advising Jon to bend the knee? Not just that but he uses Mance Rayder, who he admires, as an example of someone who let his people die because of pride and not bending the knee. So out of character, it just isn’t logical.Predictability. I already touched on this before in the lack of tension part. Daenerys was always going to save them. Everybody knew it. Viserion’s death was obvious, what wasn’t was that he was gonna die from a paddle pop popsicle (so much for the need of a ballista when you can just throw a spear at them). A dragon was always going to die this season. Oh but wait, a white walker Viserion. Probably the least predictable moment and was still pretty damn predictable. Jon wasn’t gonna die. HBO didn’t have me for a moment. Oh look it’s Benjen! Oh he’s dead. Which brings me to my next point.Benjen Stark. Ummm…. Get on the horse with him maybe? No need to die… This is just shit writing.The Daenerys and Jon scene. When he called her Dany. When he said some other thing and she said some things. Honestly I stopped watching half way through this scene.Teleporting and light speed travel. I ignore as much teleportation as I can but this is just too much. That raven is faster than light and not to mention Dany’s dragons… Gendry is very fast across snow especially after seeing it for the first time…Lastly, the amount of plot holes this mission has opened up. I really don’t want to get too into this. A wight can’t pass the wall unless it is “deactivated” like Jafer and Othor Flowers were in season 1. Benjen can’t go past the wall because he is half a wight. We’ll just ignore the fact they can bring a wight all the way to King’s Landing.That is all the reasons why I disliked this episode.
s07e06	Some things went well, some things bad.The good:Dialogue between the magnificent 7 (or whatever we’re calling them). Tormund is a national treasure, Gendry seems like a guy who’s been missing for 3 seasons, and the Hound is all of us.Battle scenes were well done, and shot beautifully. The scene with the frozen lake gives you chills literally and figuratively.Anytime there are dragons, it’s a cool episode.Viserion getting hit with an ice spear was both my favorite moment, and least favorite moment. When his eyes turn to ice, it made it more badass.The bad:I was a staunch defender of the DB team, if you go back and read my other posts. It’s getting to the point where they are harder to defend. I can’t place all the blame on DB’s, as I feel that HBO backed them into a corner with a limited budget and timeline. It makes them have to rush the script/plot in order to keep as many things moving as quickly as possible.Besides the frenetic pacing, the script is simply becoming too predictable. What made GOT better than shows like TWD (among many other reasons) is that it was unpredictable, and that we understood and sympathized with it’s characters.The dragons coming to save the Mag 7 was predictable.How many deux ex machina’s occurred in this episode alone? I counted at least 5….that’s simply way too many. Find another way to create drama.No one died except Thoros, a bunch of redshirters, and Viserion. In a plot that was basically a suicide mission. Yeah right.Emilia has been amazing this season, but I’m sorry, Kit still feels very wooden, which is why the relationship has been off. The writers could also do a better job of creating tension between the two.The Winterfell plotline with Arya/Sansa simply doesn’t make any sense, not only from an endgoal perspective, but motivational. Everything we know about Arya and Sansa tells us that they shouldn’t be falling for this LF trap. How many times did Sansa tell us that LF isn’t to be trusted? Arya chose Winterfell over her “list”, but all of a sudden family means nothing to her?Even if this turns out to be a ploy by Arya/Sansa, it will still be a wasted storyline, because we know they wouldn’t have behaved like this. Why doesn’t Arya simply tell Sansa where she got the letter? Why doesn’t Sansa put 2x2 together and figure out that LF let her find it?Overall, still the best show on TV, and of course I”ll be watching like everyone else. I just feel like the last 2 episodes especially have taken a turn for the more conventional, boring route, rather than the unpredictability that we’ve known to love about this show.
s07e06	Hate those people who try to get many upvotes by putting pictures and without saying anything interesting…So here's a short answer for once!This was supposed to be one of the greatest episod of all GoT. It was really weak in terms of scripts, dialogs and acting.First of all, it annoys me to see Jon risking his life going North of the wall. There is already Thormund who knows the place, Jon should have returned to Winterfel. I really don't like the fact that he has to risk his life doing things that others could have done.Then, nobody understands why Dany is letting Cersei the time to build 50 scorpions. Do they think that a supposed mad queen who destroyed a part of King's Landing could be a trusted ally ? Have they suddenly forgotten that everyone in GoT (Starks,, Boltons…) said that Lannisters would never come so far North ?We don't hear a thing about Dany's unsullied army… They are supposed to be stuck in Casterly Rock with no food nor mobility, are they starving ? What is happening there should be more important to Dany.As other pointed out, it was obvious that Dany would come and that Viserion would die. I hate the fact that GoT is not able to kill at least some characters when our Marvel team is facing an army… Jorah, Clegane and others should be dead ! Where is the surprising serie that GoT used to be? What is Bran doing ?The worst part is of course Arya… All of her scenes in Winterfel make no sens. There are bad acting and poorly written dialogs here. I like the fact that she should be manipulated by Littlefinger but they made it look weird. They try to make Arya look dangerous and umpredictable but she just look like a dumb girl who still can't get over her bad relationship with her sister.I enjoyed dialog between Jon and Dondarion about the meaning of there ressurection but the fight with the bear is useless. Surprisingly i liked most of the acting between Jon and Dany :-)Of course there are nice special effects but i wish that they took more time to make characters more rationnal when they make choices.Honestly i liked the fast rythm of the beginning of this season but they are now moving too fast without putting enough well written dialogs ! I wish they could calm down but this is not gonna happen :/
s07e06	It's been more than 24 hours since it officially aired so here's my take on Season 7 Episode 6 of Game of Thrones:1. Sansa and Arya’s scenes are special. Look, I know a lot of you seem to think this is just some side-plot, but I like the way Sansa reminds me of Catelyn, and Arya of Ned when it comes to politics and loyalty. They’ve both grown up in a way that complements each other’s style of leadership.Also, as Kelsey L. Hayes noted in one of her answers, Arya vs Sansa = Rhaenys and Visenya. Parallelism is becoming more prevalent this season, it seems.2. Littlefinger is one of my favorite characters, but I think his time is almost up. Chaos is a ladder, and he’s running out of wood fast. Maybe Sansa will stab him with his own dagger or Arya will get to steal his face for future use.3. Benjen's end is lazy writing. Really, can’t he just ride on the back or is there some magic barrier that prevents two riders on one horse beyond the Wall?4. They could've asked one dragon (Rhaegal) to swoop in on Jon. Oh wait, they needed to kill off Uncle Benjen.5. I saw the whole battle as too convenient for the Night King. I would’ve dismissed my suspicion as coincidence until I saw Kelsey’s take on it. Now I believe it myself: The whole trip was a trap. (more on this below)***6. Gendry somehow managed to traverse the whole damn trip back to Eastwatch in time despite being his first time north of the wall AND his first time going back.7. Ravens in GoT sure are damn fast. Seriously, birds don’t fly that fast no matter how much wind they get.8. Tyrion tried to make Dany listen and he did all he could. You can feel it. She ignored him and saved a lot of people at the expense of Viserion.9. I've known the ice dragon would appear soon in the series, given one of GRRM's book covers it. I just hoped it wouldn't be at the expense of one of Dany's dragons. Also, Dany doesn't seem to be all that sad after losing Viserion when engaging Jon. Or maybe I’m just bad at reading faces.The Ice Dragon book by GRRM.10. I'm still not buying JonxDany. It's too cliche for a show like this. I hate how everything just magically falls into place. Sorry, Ygritte is better for Jon. They should've stayed in that cave.11. This episode is probably one of their most expensive in terms of CGI and landscapes. Also, note the number of extras, real people in mocap suits, used. Perhaps the CGI we see is the reason why Ghost has become...a ghost?Edit to add: why did Tormund suddenly didn’t like Mance’s take on “not kneeling”? I mean, of all people Tormund should know why Mance didn’t kneel and what it meant as a symbol. I felt it was out of place in that mix of great exchange of words.All in all, I didn't like the episode as much as I did the last three. Sure, the dialogue exchange were fun, but it did little to distract the fact that the trip was a bad idea *and* the fact that the show seems to be really veering off from GRRM's style of storytelling.Yes, it's rushed because barely a season is left and yes, the actors' contracts as well as their interest in playing the same characters over and over again are waning. I get all that, but I like to think D&D could at least make the story progress in a way that didn't make it feel predictable and are all literally heading towards the endgame.Speaking of D&D, I think they're producing the episodes with killing characters - ones who won't be critical in the last few episodes - in mind. Now that they've run out of books to base on, their thought process must go like this:"Okay, how about character X? Did George say he's important in the last book?""No, but he says he's going to be a war hero in a side story that indirectly helps character A and B, and retire somewhere nice and warm.""...So we can kill him next season.""Yup."I'm still bitter with the *convenient* Tyrell and Martell extinction. Olenna and Doran deserved better.****Why it was a trap:The Night King had all the materials (suddenly giant chains appear), the dragon died conveniently in a place where burning it would be impossible, the Night King had the right tools for the job (I don’t recall seeing that ice spear before), and it's so convenient that the one wight that didn't disappear in their first meeting gets to be one hell of a screamer.On top of that, the "lord of light" sent them to a place where the Night King gets an ice dragon. Seems to me the Lord of Light is the devil himself based on what just happened.Edit 2: I’ve seen this question on my Facebook feed: Why didn’t the Night King aim for Drogon? I can only come up with three possible reasons:It was a show of power and prowess. He knows the people present, so he wants to show them WHY he’s the Night King.He didn’t want them dead. Sure, before he saw how they could escape, he wanted them all dead. Now that he saw they have dragons, perhaps he thought of a way to make use of Dany and her Avengers and letting them live is part of it.It’s a fucking plothole. This episode is riddled with plot holes, and really thick plot armor. It also feels the most rushed (and this season is the most rushed so far).
s07e06	The show makers wants to end it once and for all. Otherwise, this whole episode would have lasted for one season.Gendry would have been running for episodes. He did run faster than he rowed.Bear fight would have lasted for one episode.The Season finale would have been Danaerys saving them from the walkers.GOT has always left us speechless with its "Death factor”. For one must say "Valar Morghulis"Remember when Ned Stark was beheaded. The Red Wedding. Jon Snow stabbed to death. For instance, it would have been a different scenario in this episode. Yes, Viserion death was nearly unexpected. But how about Night King firing his spear right into the heart of dragon which Danaerys was flying. What a major twist this would have been. Just a small thought.Just when you think that Starks are back stronger than before. Then you see Arya and Sansa easily influenced by Little Finger and having those heated exchanges. Starks must be clever by now after what they had gone through.One character we know from the beginning that will have a huge impact is Bran. We have been waiting and waiting. Still 8 episodes left. For God's sake, do something Bran. Show is actually going to end.Uncle Benjen makes a special appearance to save Jon and refused to leave with him even though there was enough space for two. Glimpse of Titanic.I have seen websites where they post “uncut version”. Do they really have to? Nudity content has taken a huge fall compared to earlier seasons.Inspite of all these GOT still continues to be the best fantasy show ever made. Never did they make a show with huge budget. I mean there are dragons flying over every single episode.On the whole, this episode will still be one of my favourites even though it had some flaws. There was never a boring conversation or where they had to sit for hours drinking and doing nothing. You couldn't even blink for a second. Such a fast paced screenplay that we had so much little to think. Even their release has been faster than ever before.There are lots of theories floating over Internet like how GOT would end. True GOT fan would never want it to end in a classy war. Hope writers give justice to GOT for what is has been from the beginning - “The Most unpredictable Show”.
s07e06	I would say it was excellent if I was a cheap action fan. Don’t get me wrong, the word “cheap” is not for the budget, it’s for the quality.Where do I start ?Gendry’s running backRavens flying more than 1500 miles in a dayWhy did the undead army wait ? They were able to use chains but not able to cross a fracture on the ice lake ? Even ants can do it.Dany’s new wight slayer outfit.( and hair)Arya, Sansa, Littlefinger triangle.Night King’s not targeting Drogon firstJon’s getting out of the water, like it’s easy to find the hole.Benjen Stark’s coming out of nowhere and sacrificing himself.Jon’s offering his sword to Jorah during a mission when he will most definetly need a Valyrian sword. ( why didn’t he offer it to Lyanna by the way)Beric’s suggestion. “ Kill the NK, end the war “ Very good Beric. What a brilliant idea.Jon’s cry “ pull back “ To where Jon ? You are on a rock on a frozen lake surrounded by an undead army. Pull back where ??Where were the wight Giants ?Chains ??Is Night King the only one amongst the walkers who can throw a spear ?Very lazy writing, the producers are rushing to end the show. It’s obvious that they want it to end.I hope GRRM won’t do the same.
s07e06	One of the worst episodes of Game of thrones.. The show built some rules for Westeros in seasons 1–4. In this episode they went on to break all the rules, because they traded logic for visual effects.The Raven flew from East watch to Dragonstone in a matter of hours (or days???). Was that a Raven or an email? Why couldn't they come up with some logic to bring Danearys to the wall. It would have been much better had Dany come there before gendry reached the wall.. out of love of missing Jon or hiding her love with a story of "I came to see things with my own eyes" or to ask the Night King to bend his knees.. everything else would have mad sense than this fastest Raven service.Jon could have flew with Danearys.. In hardhome it all made sense for Jon to stay behind. But why now? Just for building this romance scene between Jon and Danearys they made this super illogical stunt.Beric tells Jon that he doesn't resemble Ned stark. Come on guys you must be kidding. Jon resembles Ned Stark. We are told so from book (season) 1. Now all of a sudden you make someone let this dialogue just to give weightage for R+L=J idea. Every other fan knows that. Had a fan missed the clues the show gave in last episode I bet they would not understand it now. So why would you make such illogical and contradicting dialogues.Oh then Gendry running for the Wall. Seriously? What happened to seasons 1–4 where we were shown that wildlings are the best beyond the wall? Why not send some Tormund's men? Why gendry? A summer boy runs in the snow (never forget it is the worst winter Westeros has seen in generations) and easily reaches the wall.Except for the one cool moment of the white Walker bringing down the dragon, the whole episode looked like a crap. White Walker bringing down viserion with one cool spear was the best thing that happened in this whole season.
s07e06	***SPOILER ALERT***The episode begins beyond the wall. Jon and his suicide squad want to catch a wight. There are lot of reference to earlier seasons. They are having hilarious talk. The best one is Tormond telling he wants to have babies with Brienne to Hound…hahaJon tries to return back the long claw to Sir Jorah but he claims he is unfit to bear the sword and tells Jon , longclaw belongs to Jon and his children after him.The next scene is at Winterfell. There is conflict between Arya and Sansa. Arya thinks Sansa is betraying Jon and reads the letter from the last episode. There’s a lot of tension.The next major scene is at Dragonstone where Tyrion tells that Jon loves her. There is tension in Dragonstone as well because Tyrion is concerned about the meeting with Cersei. Scene doesn't end well as Tyrion suggests her about the succesion to the throne and she can't give birth.The next scene is beyond the wall. Suicide squad is attacked by a giant bear. Some of them die. Among the major characters, Thoros is injured.Sansa and Petyr have a little talk.Back to beyond the wall. Jon and his team see a little group of wights led by a white walker. Jon kills the white walker and rest die. They capture one of those but the whole army of dead was apparently waiting for them.Jon sends back Gendry to send a raven to Dany for help. They come across the lake and the safety point is at the middle of the lake. Thousands of wights try to attack them but the ice breaks down and the dead fall into it.There is a letter for Sansa from the Kings Landing. Sansa sends Brienne on her behalf. But Brienne wants to protect her and not go south.Dany flies to North with her three dragons. Tyrion doesn’t want her to go north as he thinks she is the most important person. But she goes anyway.Back to north. John and men fight the wights while nights king is watching them. And at the climax Dany comes to help them and takes shit out of those wights with her dragon fire.One of her dragons is taken down. Everyone comes on board except Jon. Night king is ready to throw another spear to kill another one of her those dragon so she flies without Jon.Jon is saved by his uncle Benjen. He returns back to Wall on horse.Dany loses her child and is very sad. She promises Jon that she will destroy the night's king. John has bent the knee not physically but admitted that she is his queen and queen of all those people who follow him. Chemistry between Jon and Dany is a whole new level in this scene.Dead dragon is pulled out of lake and is resurrected like a wight by the night's king.THANKS FOR READING!!!!!
s07e06	Ugh, freaking finally.This episode in particular is a great example of how the show has upped the ante in terms of production values and spectacle even as the wheels are sort of coming off the narrative. Everything has looked great the past few seasons, but the story has just kind of lost its oomph as it heads into the homestretch.Specifically, it becomes ever clearer that the showrunners have a set ending that they’re working toward, and while that was always the case, it feels much more shoehorned and much less organic than it had. Whether this will seep into GRRM’s final novels remains to be seen, but it is rather clear in the show, at least.The show has a nice visual opening, sweeping up Aegon I’s Westeros table as it ends beyond the “Wall” on the table, before cutting to the Last Hero, er, Jon on the march with Tormund, Gendry, Sandor, Jorah and the redshirts.The banter across the party between the men is nice even though it’s obvious just filler. The “haha gay sex” joke between Tormund and Gendry is pretty eyeroll-worthy.I’m not a fan of Tormund’s reaction to Jon not kneeling to Dany. You’d think Tormund of all people would understand why Mance wouldn’t bend for Stannis (or could at least see that Mance kneeling to Stannis, in hindsight, wouldn’t have helped all that much).The scenery here is gorgeously shot. As I said above, visually, the show is probably unmatched this season. The starkness (no pun intended) and severity of the landscape is stunning.Now it’s Gendry and Thoros and Beric’s turn to play “dialogue roulette.” Sandor gets some good lines in though. Beric’s been killed six times and he’s not bitching about it!Aaaand now it’s Jon and Jorah’s time to bond. It’s a nice exchange between them, especially the parallel of Jeor and Ned being good men who met nasty ends. Jon, as most of us probably expected, offers to give Longclaw back to Jorah. Jorah, equally as expected, says no, and tells Jon to keep it and give it to his children. Jon’s face makes it look like he hasn’t really thought ahead.Interestingly, the immediate cutaway after this exchange about children is to Winterfell, where two other children — Sansa and Arya — reminisce. This is a great scene, with Maisie Williams really selling Arya’s self-training at archery and Ned’s quiet but definite support as he clapped for her. It’s a bittersweet anecdote, a rare case where telling and not showing works. (You also know Ned saw Lyanna in Arya there.)Here’s the gut punch, where Arya produces the letter Sansa wrote to Robb when Cersei had her prisoner in the capital. It definitely sounds bad as Arya reads it — you can see why Arya would interpret it the way she did, even though we know Sansa was under duress and she thought Ned would be spared. Arya not seeing the beheading ends up being critical, as she didn’t see Sansa’s reaction to it, only the preceding scene.Sansa lays on some hard truth — they have Winterfell back because of her. And here is the Stark sisters’ parallelism: They each survived because they each ended up in the situation they were best equipped to handle. Arya can’t comprehend Sansa’s courtly armor, so to speak, and reads it as betrayal. But Sansa equally can’t comprehend Arya’s training and what she’s been through. They’re talking past each other. Sansa’s right that Cersei would want them to turn against each other.Arya implies that she’s holding the letter over Sansa’s head, and departs. The Rhaenys/Visenya comparisons still look strong to me — each sister is doing what she thinks is best to support Jon; Sansa’s using more traditional political support, while Arya is lashing out at perceived threats to Jon’s authority, one of which is, in her mind, Sansa. It makes you wonder if the Targaryen sisters ever had private squabbles like this over what was the best thing to do, or if they ever privately distrusted each other on occasion.Back to the world’s shittiest road trip. Tormund and Sandor draw the dialogue short straws. We get a nice “kissed by fire” callback and yet again we get the backstory of Sandor’s burned face. And yet another gay sex joke. Now, an episode highlight, where Sandor realizes that Tormund’s crush is Brienne and we get to see that Tormund really does have a thing for her. “You do know her.” “We’ve met.”Beric’s chat about Jon not looking like his father is nice except … Jon looks like Ned. That’s the entire point — he’s all “Stark.” I guess it’s a way to keep Jon’s mother hanging around. Jon is not keen on Beric’s evangelism, exactly. The “death is the enemy” thing sounds nice until you remember that death is natural and the Others, in their own way, also defeat death, by raising wights.Sandor IDs the arrowhead mountain as the one he saw in the flames. Can we pause here to note that the “lord of light,” whatever it actually is, seems to have deliberately led these guys here? That seems important!Tyrion and Dany are just chilling on Dragonstone. (Where the hell is Theon? Has he asked Dany to rescue Yara yet?) Dany tells Tyrion she likes that he isn’t a hero, because heroes run off and get killed. Tyrion tells Dany that the heroes she names are all in love with her. Dany denies that Jon loves her and for the second time we get “Jon was looking at Dany” as a tell-don’t-show descriptor. Dany says Jon’s “too little” for her and has to sort of backtrack given Tyrion’s dwarfism.We have a Dany-Cersei meeting teed up. Dany says Cersei would want to kill her as if she herself hadn’t been ready to ride off to burn down the Red Keep with Cersei in it if Tyrion and Jon hadn’t talked her out of it.Tyrion takes the chance to try to talk Dany out of her raging id inclinations. Tyrion says fear is all Cersei has and Dany mentions how far Aegon I got on fear. Tyrion says Dany isn’t different from other tyrants if she wants to get by on fear and mass murder.Oooh, Tyrion used the I word. Impulsive! Tyrion tells Dany she loses her temper occasionally, covering his butt with some “great leader” ass-kissing after. Smooth! Tyrion finally says that burning the Tarlys was excessive. Dany yet again accuses Tyrion of siding with his family over her. Tyrion, to his credit, stands his ground even if he drops in the usual “I believe in you” caveats.And now we get the succession talk. Both of them have points here: It’s presumptuous to lay out succession when you don’t have the throne, but it’s also unwise to claim a crown without a long-term plan. (Isn’t that, after all, what Cersei is doing?) Dany accuses Tyrion of thinking about her death too much, which … eesh.This episode in particular is heavy on Dany being unable to have children, which feels like ham-fisted foreshadowing that she’s not actually infertile. I don’t think she is infertile (in the books she’s able to at least get pregnant again, but miscarries). But I’m unsure of where they’re going with this — I can see “Jon and Dany have baby” is a popular guess, but if the final season has the same pacing as this one, there’s almost no way an entire pregnancy span is getting covered in the last season (more so if this season ends with any sort of cliffhanger immediacy; they probably can’t jump ahead too far). I also still expect both Jon and Dany to die before this is over. It’s possible the infertility is more about the succession and how Dany plans for it — does R+L=J play into it at all, when it’s known — and not necessarily a pregnancy.Hello, polar bear wight. Goodbye, wildling redshirt. This is a really intense scene, especially the men circling around together with their swords out as the bear picks them off. They’re finally able to put the wight bear down, but not before Thoros has gotten mauled (he’s still alive though and Beric cauterizes the wound with his goddamn flaming sword). And like that, it’s over — I hope everyone liked it because this scene is probably why we haven’t seen Ghost in a season and a half.Sansa is talking to Littlefinger about the letter not knowing Littlefinger deliberately turned it up to turn Sansa and Arya against each other. This has to end this season, right? Littlefinger can’t keep jerking Sansa around for another full season. And we get the disparity between them again: Sansa is trying to preserve Jon’s army, where Arya is more concerned about Sansa’s loyalty to Jon personally. Littlefinger tells Sansa to get Brienne involved if she thinks Arya is planning to try anything — or warns Sansa that Brienne would get involved if she thought Arya were in danger.We finally get the infamous Thoros-at-Pyke story that’s come up like twice before. Turns out Thoros was drunk and doesn’t remember it. Now you know!Seriously, does each non-redshirt member of this party have to have a cutaway dialogue scene with every other member?The men stumble onto a wight procession. It’s not that many of them, just a handful, led by one Other. Jon notes that this isn’t the full group. You have to wonder what the hell they’re doing out there and why such a small group is out. Jon and Co. ambush the wights. Jon kills the Other with Longclaw, and almost all the wights around go limp (is this the Other that turned them?). One wight doesn’t go limp and they decide to wight-nap it for their proof, but not before it screams like hell to probably alert all the others.So … this was totally a trap, right? Bait? Have an Other and a few wights out on a scavenger-type hunt to eventually give away Jon and Co.’s position? Because that’s what it looks like and I cannot think of any other reason for this random-ass Other to be leading a little clutch of wights.Jon sends Gendry back to Eastwatch to get a raven to Dany. Gendry runs back to Eastwatch on foot and somehow makes it back in decent time despite having never seen snow before and only seeing this area literally the one time and never by himself. Sure! (Tormund steals the hammer, lol.)The men run forward and find themselves on a frozen lake that starts to crack underneath them, before the wights start pouring through the pass after them. They risk the ice and run across to an island in the middle of it. Another redshirt bites it but the ice gives and for now the men are safe-ish on the island. There’s an amazing distance shot of a circle of wights gaining on the men and then stopping.The men and their wight-nappee chill out on their icy island all night and somehow don’t freeze to death.In a perfect cliche, Gendry collapses right outside the Eastwatch gate before men come out to collect him and he tells them to send a raven.Real talk: There is no way a raven gets from Eastwatch to Dragonstone for Dany to read and respond to before these guys all die. I know we forgive a lot with teleportation and stuff, but this may be the most ridiculous one yet. They could have had her camped out at Eastwatch waiting for a signal or something, fine. But this is too much even by the show’s more relaxed standards of late.Thoros has finally expired. RIP Thoros. I am still not sure we needed the wight polar bear.Jorah wants to take on the Others directly and Jon says no. Beric says they need to kill the Night King and reminds everyone the lord of light brought him and Jon back. (He also brought them to this godforsaken area of doom!)Sansa’s gotten a letter from down south (not clear if it’s from Tyrion or Cersei, just an invitation to King’s Landing). Sansa sends Brienne south to speak for her. Sansa, not stupidly, says she’s not leaving Winterfell. She gets a bit sassy with Brienne when Brienne tries to talk to her about safety, but Brienne agrees to go finally. Again: The Littlefinger stuff has to wrap up soon. I assume Brienne is going to parley with everyone else and witness the wight-napping.Even dragons need to nap. Dany got the world’s fastest raven and is going to go help. Tyrion tries to talk her out of it, Dany’s not having it, and flies off on Drogon. Rhaegal and Viserion take off after her too. (How did she keep them from showing up at the battle the last time?)Aside: A Dany fan, as they have been wont to do, added a 100% off-topic comment to an answer of mine that had nothing to do with Dany, asking if my “unjustified contempt” for Dany would “come to an end” since she flew off to help Jon and Co. And, honestly … no? As far as I’m concerned all of the issues with Dany still remain, even if she did this one thing right (also worth noting that Jon, for now, is still unaware of her worst moments). The episode did also bother to include her continued paranoia regarding Tyrion and her belief that she was right to burn the Tarlys. Everything she’s done and said — including in this very same episode — still stands, even if she’s done this particular thing right.Sandor throws a rock and oops the ice is frozen over now. A wight heads out toward them, followed by another, and another, and shit’s about to get real. The men start engaging the wights and it looks pretty hopeless. Tormund in particular has a close call before Sandor of all people saves him. (Not only does everyone have to have dialogue with everyone else, everyone has to save everyone else’s butt once.) They all have to fall back to higher ground and it looks like Tormund, Sandor, Beric, Jon and Jorah are the only ones left alive now (Thoros is dead, Gendry left and I think all the redshirts bit the dust).This is such a visually stunning scene that you almost forget how goddamn terrible the wight-napping idea is. Like, they needed an excuse to get Jon and Co. above the Wall, and Dany and the dragons. So they came up with this wight-napping. It’s still dumb even if it gets the endgame they needed for the sequence.It all looks hopeless as Jon looks around to everyone. The wights are getting close and then boom in come the dragons. I’m not gonna lie: This is supremely cool and shows what dragons can do when they aren’t used to burn prisoners alive. This is, really, why you would want dragons, to burn through all those wights. Drogon lands and the men hop on. Jon, because he’s Jon, lets the others get on first.The Night King gets handed a big damn ice spear that he, cool as a damn cucumber and completely devoid of any sort of emotion or expression, heaves into the air to knock Viserion out of the sky. Dragons burning wights is cool; this is cooler, because it’s so damn abrupt. (Also cool: The way the camera is facing, it looks like the Night King might be aiming for Drogon first, since he’s on the ground and directly in front of the Night King. It’s only when the Night King releases the spear that you can tell for sure that he’s going for Viserion.)RIP Viserion. That must have been a mother of a spear. The dragon sliding into the lake is unexpectedly sad, at least for me — I am not generally sentimental about dragons. Emilia Clarke does the mile-long stare look that looks vaguely sad.Jon sacrifices himself so the others can fly away. The Night King chucks another spear up at them and misses, and Jorah almost falls off but ends up safe. Jon’s left behind. I think Drogon is sadder about Viserion dying than Dany is.Benjen shows up literally just to save Jon, and holds them off so Jon can ride off on the horse. I know we already knew Benjen was out there somewhere, but … really? They couldn’t have sped up the Targaryen-wanking fan service and had Rhaegal show up to cart him off? Benjen just happened to be around there but didn’t show up at all before then? It’s just weird.Dany and Jorah are on the lookout at Eastwatch and Jon finally makes it back. He’s in pretty bad shape. On the ship, he’s put into bed and Davos and Co. undress him. Dany sees the scars on his body, and figures out he really was stabbed in the heart.Aside: Jon’s stab wounds look just like they did when he was resurrected, right? There’s no scarring over. It looks like a wound without blood. I know everyone’s fixated on Dany’s possible infertility, but are we sure Jon can have kids? Is he just kind of … frozen … now? Can the resurrected dead father children?Sansa finds Arya’s collection of murder faces. Arya catches her and Sansa gets a taste of Arya’s Faceless Men training. Sansa’s legitimately worried about Arya wanting to kill her. They play the game of faces and Sansa’s not really into it. Arya still thinks Sansa’s not loyal to Jon. Arya tells Sansa that neither of them got to be what they wanted to be, but they sort of did, right? Sansa’s a de facto queen in Jon’s absence, and Arya’s more dangerous than probably any knight. Arya tells Sansa she can become her, and … I’m really not sure what we’re meant to take away here. Is Arya going overboard or is Sansa legitimately hoping Jon doesn’t come back (which seems unlikely?). Arya gives Sansa the Valyrian steel dagger and leaves.Jon wakes up and Dany’s there with him. He apologizes for losing the dragon and … I think she’s over it? Dany says she’s glad she went so she could see what they were up against. Jon calls her Dany — which feels heavy-handed, but OK. And Jon swears fealty to her now that she’s done something to actually warrant it. It’s a sweet moment but — and yeah, I don’t like it, I’m probably biased, blah blah — it all feels a little too tidy, too early. And we still have R+L=J looming in the background, which, if it’s revealed and it doesn’t affect anything, there’s no point in it. It exists to upend shit.The Night King had a bunch of chains ready to go to haul Viserion’s body out of the frozen lake. Apparently there is a Home Depot north of the Wall. The Night King approaches the dead dragon, turns him into a wight, and that’s all she wrote for this one.Aside: Before watching the episode but knowing what happened, I theorized that the Night King had foreseen what would happen and had essentially laid a trap to get a dragon wight (perhaps he can use Viserion to break through the Wall?). After seeing it, I think this is right — the Night King picking the harder target first has a sense of destiny to it, the lone Other and its bait wights, the complete lack of surprise or emotion on the Night King’s face (he’s at least shown concern and/or curiosity before, at Hardhome), the random-ass chains at the ready. It’s like he knew this would happen — which makes the lord of light leading the men to this spot that much more fucked up.Final thoughts: This episode was so visually arresting that you almost forget how limp-dick the story is this time. The plan itself is terrible, they have to rely on dialogue-roulette to kill time before the main fight, we get a polar bear wight that looks nice but doesn’t really … do anything (Thoros could have been killed another way). The dragons’ arrival was really cool and is probably a taste of what’s to come. I’m also getting bored with Arya and Sansa’s Winterfell intrigue and I’m guessing it gets settled soon and gets settled with both of them ending up on the same side, with Littlefinger caught red-handed and capped. (Presumably both of them have major endgame roles that necessitate them being kept alive/around, and this season’s wheel-spinning is a way to keep both of them on ice, as it were.)
s07e06	This isn’t so much a review of Season 7 - Episode 6, more an opinion of Season 7 in general.Bas Leijser has pretty much nailed what is wrong with GoT in his answer but, I’m going to elaborate a little.GoT from the first the episode has always been a series unafraid to shock or remove characters we might have become fond of, even the nasty ones. The Starks, The Tulleys, The Freys, The Boltons, Tywin Lannister, Joffrey, Oberon, Stannis, Hodor – the list goes on.Series 7 from the very first episode just projected an entirely different vibe. I couldn’t quite put my finger on what it was and I said to my wife after watching it a few weeks back, that it felt – generic. There was a palpable mundaneness to it. It was a decent episode and all six have been decent but, there has been a noticeable shift in the dynamic of what we have come to expect from this series.For instance, Jamie Lannister, who is one of my favourite characters. He charges a dragon which is about to incinerate him only to be miraculously saved by Bronn – who was actually nowhere near him when he got on the horse or when he got close to the dragon. When he survived, I cannot tell you how pissed off I was because, for me, that was the first time that the series has baulked at making a tough choice. By allowing Jamie to inexplicably survive (and he shouldn’t have done), GoT surrendered to the well-trodden path that destroys the best of TV series. Expectancy!This has now been carried on by other ludicrous events.The runner (Gendry) Jon Snow sends back to Castle Black in order to send a Raven to Daenerys was ridiculous all ways around. The dead were on top of the group as he left, yet he managed to run over what appeared to be a days hike through the snow, and get a raven to Daenerys so she could hop on her dragons to save Jon and his merry band.Let’s not forget she was thousands of miles away. We are talking a week – at least, for the bird to get to her and her to even get close to Jon. How much more exciting would it have been had the dead overwhelmed Jon and his group once the ice refroze? Alas, the producers bottled it and instead having the courage to kill off a couple more important characters, we lose a couple of nobodies who nobody cares about - and a Dragon.And the Dragons death was telegraphed a mile away. Once it sunk beneath the ice, I said to the wife, “what’s going to stop the white Walkers reanimating it and using it?” Lo and behold, the white walkers pulled it out of the ice so they could use it – with chains that wouldn’t be out of place on HMS Queen Elizabeth. Where they got the chains from in the middle of a barren wasteland, I have no idea. It’s so fucking predictable that I imagine rather than fire, the dragon will now shoot ice.Also, given that Daenerys has flown all that way to save Jon, surely she could have had one of her dragons incinerate the White Walkers for good measure? It’s not as if they were inconspicuous sat on horses with white faces and bright blue eyes on the side of a hill, sticking out like a sore thumb!Surely, it would not be beyond the wit of an intelligent attacker to think, “you know what, those creepy dudes look important so I’ll take them out”. But no, she has all three dragons blowing fire on the zombies. I get that this would have ended the threat of the White Walkers – which the whole series has been building to, but by avoiding to do the obvious, it makes the series stupid and insinuates that the viewers must be stupid as well.So yes, I’m annoyed. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a wonderful series and one which remains unmissable but, I no longer wait for each episode wondering who might not make it because it’s clear that as we near the climax, the producers have gotten cold feet and are now playing it safe.It’s such a shame because Game of Thrones over the last six years has set itself such a high benchmark by being completely unafraid to make tough decisions that for it to get so close to the end and succumb to the formulaic TV approach now, is a damn tragedy.
s07e06	Warning…..Spoilers…..Are…….Coming……Okay. Well. It was an amazing episode. But I will admit, nothing happened that I didn’t expect.Let’s start with many conversations. They were good, especially between Tormund and the Hound about Brienne of Tarth, Jorah and Jon about Jeor Mormont, and Beric and Jon about coming back to life. It was nice to see them interact and the things they talked about seemed plausible, I like how they are all connected in some way and the show delved into that.Capturing the wight was fun. As was fighting the bear wight which didn’t vote for irony in trying to kill Jorah. Nice to see Gendry live by running as a messenger, it made sense too, no way was he going to plausibly survive the battle to come.And of course the wight can scream and act like a beacon. Of course he can. The surrounding of them on the mound was awesome, as was Beric’s idea that they take out the Night King. I expected him to die in an attempt. Shame it didn’t happen. Though of course it was mission impossible anyway.Then Thoros died. Sad to see the drunk go even if there was not much attachment to him, not so sad to see the unnamed characters die, it was there fault for going on the trip and not being important afterall.Now the big set piece, if you didn’t expect Dragons to fly in and save the day, alongside one of them dying, don’t get into the writing business. A novice could have written that. Yet it didn’t make it any less awesome to actually see it on screen!Okay so everyone can hang on to a dragon while it flies now. Again, I keep thinking about the death of the dragon. It was like a direwolf to me. Again though, completely expected. Oh and Jon rises out of the water of course.Again (and I am using that word top much now), if you did not expect Uncle Benjen to suddenly appear and sacrifice his life so Jon could get away, don’t become a writer. This was not surprising. It was actually a clever spoiler I unfortunately read earlier this year that “a Stark” will die. Clever bastards throwing me off that trail.Dany now knows about the threats beyond the wall, she lost a child because of it. And again, of course that dragon became a wight. An Ice Dragon has been predicted for years now, and the Season 7 posters had unfortunately spoilt this already. And she also knows that Jon literally took a knife to the heart.Their emotional scenes at the end felt completely off and forced. But give credit where it’s due, the writers really want us to feel the connection, and they are trying really hard.I fully expected Beric to die. And now my prediction that he will die in the same way as he does in the books is actually stronger. He will give his life force to resurrect another, now that Thoros is gone the show can get away with this. I vote for the Hound. They are getting on really well now afterall.Now onto Winterfell. Booooo. Winterfell has been terrible this season, Arya has been even worse than that too. Why was no Raven sent to Winterfell at all about the journey beyond the wall. Seriously! A message won’t hurt. Why doesn’t Bran check in with a Raven. Actually, where was Bran! And Sansa, why has she not realised that Littlefinger is causing shit.Anyway, time to wait for the 80? Minute episode finale. I’m sure the wall will fall, setting up the final season as an all out battle.All in all a very enjoyable, tense, emotional, and frightening episode.9.5/10NOTE: I have seen some tw*t completely plagiarizing my review for this episode and I reported it. My words were literally copy and pasted on a different question. Not sure if Quora gets at it automatically. But you should know this is the real copy, this is my voice that can’t be replicated. And that whoever you are, you are an embarrassment to yourself.
s07e06	I don’t need to add spoiler tags. If you are reading answers to this question before watching the episode, then really your fault.I watched the episode twice just to absorb everything there was.I will do a mini recap, and then my major takeaways including what I noticed.The episode was ‘Fellowship of the Ring’ meets a bad copy of ‘Resident Evil’, then they both meet ‘Single White Female’.Beyond the WallThe expedition beyond the Wall on foot was pretty nonsensical. I am sure they could have taken a few horses with them. Considering Westeros has shrunk to the size of a miniature suburb, they don’t need to. The conversations were okay. Many have enjoyed it. I didn’t. I kept an open mind. It didn’t entertain me much, though. It was a bit of a filler. Tormund and the Hound were better than the rest. They spot a bear. Bear attacks Jorah. Bear on Bear action! Heh Thoros will meet his end in this episode.They fall upon a mini group of Wights and a Whitewalker. We find out that killing the Whitewalker kills the ones he has turned deus ex machina style. The one Wight remains and they capture him. Mission almost complete. The Wight acts as a beacon to alert its other friends. The gang make Gendry run back to Eastwatch to pass a message along to Dany. Yes, run to Eastwatch.That is how big the Wall must be.This is what has become of Westeros size-wise. I see King’sroad has improved in quality.Davos meets a semi-concious Gendry and they get the ravens off to Dany.The Wights attack a retreating Jon & Co. They take refuge on a mini island in the middle of the lake. The rest of the Wights fall into the icy lake and for the moment Jon & Co are safe. This part is very interesting. The NK and his other Walkers are nearby. They can see the humans. At first, I wondered why the NK wasn’t bringing ‘winter’ or a blizzard to freeze the lake so the Wights can attack. The NK had hatched a plan though. He had laid a trap to keep Jon and Co till the real cavalry comes. Then he can make his kill. The Hound gets bored and starts tossing rocks which do not break the ice cover on the lake. The Wights being somewhat mindless attack the humans. Fighting carries on for long before Jon realises they are lost. This part reminded me off ‘Gears of War 3’, ‘Brothers to the end’ chapter where Dom realises they are a lost cause before he sacrifices himself to save Marcus and the rest.When all seems lost, Dany arrives with her 3 dragons. Jon and Co were on that mini island for one night at best. But sure, ravens can fly to Dragonstone and Dany can fly to the Wall in that time. Dany burns through the Wights and the men are saved. The Wight is placed on Drogon and they are ready to fly.Enter, the Night King. This was easily the best part of the episode and almost the best part of the season apart from everything Jaime Lannister. The Night King throws an ice javelin and takes down Viserios to my cheers and goosebumps. The dragon drowns in the lake and so does Jon, nearly. Dany takes off distraught whilst Jon is saved by Benjen Stark.Back at Eastwatch, Dany anxiously awaits the unlikely return of Jon. He does return. He is taken inside a Targaryen ship and stripped out of his icy cloths. Dany realises that Jon has taken a knife to the heart. Jon wakes up and they have a ‘heartfelt’ moment. Jon agrees to bend the knee. Dany is ecstatic and in tears.The Wights pull out Viserion from the pond and he is turned into a Wight dragon.DragonstoneTyrion and Dany discuss the issues of war and the meeting with Cersei. The possibility of a trap is discussed. Tyrion goes through another lesson with Dany whilst Dany hits back with ‘wars always cause bloodshed’. They both have a point. The issue of succession comes up which Dany refuses to address before she receives ravens from the other end of the backyard. She gathers her dragons and flies off to save Jon.WinterfellArya reminisces about Ned. She speaks fondly of him, his reactions to Arya not abiding by Westerosi cultural norms and embracing the warrior within her. She goes on to single out Sansa for not being a part of them often enough. For always playing the ‘lady’ and leaning more to southern ways. They argue over the letter Sansa had written during her time as a hostage in the RK. Sansa feels concerned if the letter gets out to the lords of the North. She discusses the matter with LF and he advises her to use Brienne against Arya if need be. Sansa receives a message from KL inviting her for a parley. She orders Brienne to go to KL in her stead. Sansa then searches Arya’s room and finds her faces. She is freaked out and Arya walks in on her. Arya describes what the faces are and hands her the Valyrian steel dagger, hilt first.My takeaways & what I noticed.During the opening credits, the sea next to Eastwatch is not frozen. I noticed this in the last episode too. Whereas in the first 4 episodes it was frozen with plenty of conjecture on whether the Whitewalkers could simply walk around the Wall. I am not sure if this is an error or delibrate. But the Stag on top of the RK is still present. And now the seas have unfrozen.The episode began quite slow. The Fellowship of the Wight on foot was a filler. They should really be mounted. The conversations were not as entertaining as many others point them out to be. Tormund and the Hound made it tolerable. However, a few key pieces of information were mentioned,Tormund suggests that many died for Mance’s pride as he wouldn’t ‘bend the knee’. This is inconsistent. Mance did not bend the knee, for the Wildlings. It was not his pride. He did not bend the knee because he had promised the Wildlings that he wouldn’t kneel to southern lords and kings. He managed to unite the Wildlings because he was not a kneeler. The show is trying hard to convince us that Jon has to ‘bend the knee’ to Dany so people don’t die.Jorah tells Jon that ‘his children’ will wield Longclaw as well. This stuns Jon for a moment. Perhaps, Jon is thinking of children for the first time. Legitimate children. Possibly, with Dany. Their romance is almost a sure thing now.Beric and Jon discuss the war against the dead. They agree that they are humans united who fight against death. Jon recites ‘I am the shield that guards the realms of men’. This is a reference to the Night’s Watch and possibly the fact that the NW will be Lightbringer in the books. ‘By night all cloaks look black’. The NW will consist of all humans united against the Others once the Long Night falls. No matter the colour of their cloaks, they will look black once darkness falls.The group face a bear where the extra men die. This was a waste of CGI budget. They could have spent it on Ghost. He is a wild beast from beyond the Wall and he would have thrived there. Nonetheless, this hints that more wild animals could fight with the Whitewalkers which makes the task that much more difficult. The group then fall on a Whitewalker and his minions. The Wights all fall once the Whitewalker who had turned them dies. This will be used as a battle technique in the future where the humans may form two groups. One, holding off the Wights whilst the second attacks the Whitewalkers and try to finish the job faster.They capture the one Wight who must have been turned by some other Walker. He acts as a beacon and alerts the others. Gendry is sent to run back to the Wall which was ridiculous. This is the very interesting part. Jon and Co take refuge on the rock whilst the Wights wait behind. The NK is present. The Whitewalkers bring winter and blizzards. The NK could have easily frozen the lake and have the Wights annihilate the humans. But he didn’t. This is the only part that made the episode great. The Night King. He seems to have laid a trap and waited for Dany and her dragons. He knew there was support coming. He even had an ice javelin specifically ready for dragons. This indicates the Night King has powers we do not know yet. He must be able to ‘see the future’. Either, through visions sent to him by a deity. Or, he is a greenseer. Which would explain how he interacted with Bran in a vision in season 6 and marked him. Greenseers can send visions and maybe able to interact with each other in dreams and visions. Will the NK send Bran incorrect visions as traps? Or will Bran trap and defeat him using his greenseeing powers? We have seen previously that the NK can knock Bran out of ravens. He must be a more powerful greenseer and warg than Bran. At least at the moment. Before Bran’s powers develop further. If the NK was originally a Stark, it would tie him to Bran even further. Specially, if he was a Brandon Stark.The raven travels to Dragonstone and Dany travels beyond the Wall in almost one night. The show will play even more ridiculous tricks with distance and time to fit everything in one episode. This was the most disappointing part of the episode. We also realise that Dany loves to play the mother. She hears that Jon and his men are in trouble. And she runs to help them. Whereas initially she didn’t care if Jon and the whole northern population die fighting the Whitewalkers. She still has no proof that the Whitewalkers exist barring a message on a raven. Something which she had seen before. She can’t help herself playing ‘the saviour’. She had no idea what awaited her beyond the Wall, or how dangerous it could be. She took her children there without any other form of support. This is probably what will cause her downfall. She has to be the saviour and rushes heedlessly into battle. The other assumption the show makes is that the northern conditions and severe cold do not affect dragons or their fire. Something which will be a focal point in the books. But not in the show. Dany burns through the Wights quite easily and so do her two other dragons. The Night King dismounts and he is handed his already made weapon. His brings down Viserion. As expected, the battle needs to be fair and Dany can not just waltz in burning her way to victory. It was a welcome sight. Score 1, for the White walkers. They can always create more Wights. But Dany can not hatch another dragon. Viserion falls to the lake and sinks in the waters. This is an allusion to the Ice Dragon, who dissolves into an icy pond when dead. This part was well done. Dany and the men get away while Jon sinks to the bottom of the lake. The NK’s second shot misses Drogon. Rhaegal gets away too. Jon gets out of the lake alive and Benjen comes along to save him whilst he sacrifices himself. Benjen can not go back with him as he can not pass the magic of the Wall. Benjen’s journey finally ends. It is unknown whether he is permanantly dead, or he can still be raised as a Wight. Dany clearly is worried for Jon and it is more than just comradry. Dany has feelings for him. He finally arrives at Eastwatch. There is a Targaryen ship in the sea. I am willing to forgive the dragons flying to the Wall instantaneously. But a fucking ship? You can’t sail to Eastwatch from Dragonstone in the middle of winter. It is not even a direct line journey. Stops at Braavos or the Fingers are recommended. Dany realises that Jon has taken a knife to the heart. Where this leads is unknown. Something has to come of his resurrection and the coversation surrounding it. Jon is the worst damn king ever. He and Tyrion go well together. Bad Hand, worse king. Jon abandoned his kingdom and spent half the season in Dragonstone. He has failed to send ravens to Winterfell updating them. Which is not too difficult on the show. It takes 5minutes for the ravens to reach. He failed to stop by Winterfell on the way to Eastwatch. He and his de facto Hand have abandoned their men. The men they expect to fight for them and hold the north against the biggest threat in the world. Now, he bends the knee and expects the northern lords and the Vale to understand. After Dany has willingly decided to help them. This is very low from Jon. He surrendered the north and the Vale very quickly because of his feelings. The threat of the NK was always there. He resisted initially, but his feelings got the better of him and he bent the knee. I expect backlash in the north and I honestly hope Sansa takes over. She is politically astute and very strong compared to Jon at the moment. Take note that Dany changed her costume for the first time this season. She changed into Stark colours before flying to Jon’s aid. A not so subtle hint that she will become a ‘Stark’ woman.I think Jon was just confirmed as a dragon rider. I say this because the ending where he gets away is revealing. The shot has him and the top part of the horse only, similar to how Dany is shown when she rides a dragon. Dany and the top part of Drogon. Usually, a wider shot of the horse and rider are shown. But Jon and a partial part of his horse were focussed on. For an extended period. I think that is foreshadowing his future on a dragon. It was basically a shot of how he may look on a dragon.The NK has his minions pull out Viserion using chains. The presence of chains, the order and the dicipline through which this is done indicates the Night King was prepared. He must have seen the future. I am very intrigued to find out more about him. Viserion is turned into a Wight dragon. He could be the tool to bring the Wall down. ‘Nothing burns like the cold’. That quote is important from the books. Viserios could melt the Wall and the NK could finally pass the Wall on a dragon. Happy times :)I have little to say about Dragonstone. Tyrion and Dany go back and forth. They both have genuine points. No war is done without bloodshed. But Dany is acting like every other ruler at the moment in spite of her claims to break the wheel. It is interesting that the succession issue comes up. She refuses to address it since she can’t apparently have children. Very interesting that both Jon and Dany are lectured about ‘children and heirs’ in the same episode. It would be easier if D&D put them both in a heart shaped bed and put Marvin Gaye on. Tyrion alludes to a democracy, which I don’t think Westeros is ready for. But the show may end with that. In the books, I expect a system similar to the Free Cities. Less feudalistic. Corrupt and greed oriented nonetheless.The Winterfell issue between Arya and Sansa is confusing, interesting, and generic at the same time. I expected Arya and Sansa to get along far better due to their respective maturity. Arya still doubts Sansa. Which is not fair in my opinion. Sansa was a hostage and a hostage does what is required for their own safety. Which is what Arya did in Harrenhal. I love Arya, I am not a die hard Sansa fan. Although, in the books, I respect her development, the complexity of her character and themes related to her chapters a lot. On this occassion, Sansa has the right of it. Arya is intimidating and scaring her which relates back to their differences and sisterly animosity during childhood. Sansa is quite freaked out by the faces she finds. And rightly so. Arya at the end gives Sansa a chance to prove herself as a true Stark. This will determine what happens with Littlefinger and the girls. I expected him to die this season. But he looks like he will make it to season 8. He is finally weaving some webs and it is making his character interesting once again. I am keen to see how the girls deal with him and how he is exposed.Brienne is sent to KL in Sansa’s stead. She may meet with Jon there as he and Dany bring the Wight to Dragonpit. Finally, Jon can actually send a message back to the north and tell them he has ‘bent the knee’. LF should use this as an opportunity to cause more havoc in the north. This was not Jon’s wisest plan. Dany had already chosen to help. She had seen the army of the dead and could not unsee it. She could no longer refuse to help even if Jon didn’t bend the knee. Brienne’s meeting with Jaime should be interesting. If Cersei decides not to help or double cross them, this should finally set Jaime against her. A Wight should sway Jaime. I have been waiting for Jaime to turn against Cersei. But the show won’t make it happen. Maybe, in 2019. The Hound looks like he will go to KL. Cleganebowl? I am hoping for it. Un-Gregor may try to do something to Jon or Dany with the Hound stepping in the middle.I intitially disliked the episode. My second viewing gave me a different perspective. The NK, the complexity of his plot and the implications of his powers are very well done. He salvaged the episode for me. The Wights were second hand rentals from bad Resident Evil films. And the battle prior to dragons was similar to zombie films. Very average. It was no Hardhome, Winds of Winter or episode 3 of this season where Jaime ruled and embarrassed Tyrion.Bran has his hands full if the NK has greenseeing powers. The conclusion of the season should provide us with plenty of Bran and what Sam has in his books.
s07e06	It was a relatively good episode. It created a nice atmosphere (which is not to be taken for granted after the last episodes) and also had humor, emotion, and action. I’d give it an 8/10.Props to Rory (Sandor), Ian (Jorah), and Richard (Beric) for their acting. Kit (Jon) also played quite well. On the contrary, I found Emilia’s (Dany) acting to be very weak; even Jorah seemed more genuinely heartbroken with Viserion’s death.It was nice seeing all those different characters try to get along with each other. Perhaps they were too lighthearted or focused on things that now seem unimportant, but again, “there [is] nothing like the prospect of death to make a man feel alive.” They were quite a fellowship, anyway.Cinematography was very good; it focused on the fire/ice dichotomy and gave us memorable instances (e.g. the Night King aiming at the flying dragon).I was surprised when I saw the wights dissolve as soon as the Other who turned them was killed. Is that a new thing? I assume it will be of importance, but for the time being I simply find it a bit baffling. Perhaps it was just a step towards the realization that the Night King’s death would be the end of the entire army (see below).The worst thing was probably the revelation/conclusion that it’s enough to do something relatively minor (in this case kill the Night King) to make the entire army disband. It’s so clichéd (Independence Day: the mother ship, The Return of the King: the Ring, Star Wars: the Death Star pipe) that I sincerely hoped they wouldn’t use it on this show too—alas, it seems I was wrong. It also gives the show runners a cheap and easy way to end the war whenever they want: the wights can conquer everything, a lot of character may die, but at the end Jon will approach the Night King, duel him, and kill him. I’m categorically against that.Gendry going all the way back to the Wall running (!) and collapsing on the perfect spot, the Night’s Watch sending the raven to Dany, and the dracones ex machina arriving at the right moment (in less than 40 hours or so) was another example of plot holes and cliches that we simply have to swallow.Jon calling Daenerys “Dany” for no reason at all (How did he learn that name? Is it another Targaryen feature?) was cheesy and very unsubtle. The same goes for Beric’s comment that Jon doesn’t look like Ned. OK, we got it, he’s a bloody Targaryen, don’t hit us with a hammer every two minutes, and above all stop degrading his Stark heritage. He’s supposed to look like Lyanna, who looked like Arya and Ned. End of story.The Sansa-Arya plot line was better this episode, although it’s taken a bit too far. They have Bran there, for God’s sake. Why not ask him everything? I liked the conclusion we are expected to reach: neither Arya would survive in Sansa’s place, nor Sansa in Arya’s. They are different, but equally tough and good at surviving, each in her own way.I found a bit strange the fact that Tormund used the same wording as Dany about Jon’s pride and survival. Again, they hit us with a hammer to pave the ground for Jon’s submission. It’s cheap and unrealistic. Mance didn’t bend the knee, although he was aware of the danger, and Tormund himself had once told Jon that he’s not a “kneeler” anymore. I don’t know what’s going to happen next, but at least I hope it’s either a love affair between Jon and Dany or Jon bending the knee to ensure his people’s survival, but not both.Last but not least, again very abruptly and unsubtly, the show chose to focus on Daenerys’ child bearing abilities in multiple scenes. I take it as a foreshadowing that she will give birth at the end. I sincerely hope there’s something tragic there. Seeing Jon and Dany’s child on the Iron Throne will be way over the top.
s07e06	Another fantastic episode leaked in bad quality. Argh.Moving on -Jon & team chat up on the way North. Expected, nice, predictable. Moving on. I’ll come back beyond the wall later.Daenerys and Tyrion talking about her impulse..and suddenly the conversation moves to succession? Stick to one topic, please?Arya is threatening Sansa. She really wants her to make amends. And in Arya’s terms, the amends are going to be drastic. There’s just so much here that seems hotch-potch -They’ve met Bran. They’ve seen what he is capable of. Why the hell do they not go to him with their questions? I know he seems weird, but he’s been right on the money about what happened to them. Are these girls that bloody stupid!? They practically have Google in the form of Bran!Sansa has boasted about how the North is more loyal than the rest. And now when it suits the plot, it can all go to shit, of course.Sansa has repeatedly said LF is not to be trusted. And yet, he is the only one she seems to be trusting at this point. More than Arya, or Brienne, or even Bran! For God’s sake, Sansa, grow a brain! Stop divulging your plans to LF of all people!LF warns Sansa about Brienne, and now Sansa has sent Brienne away. Does this mean she is planning something for Arya? What the shit is up here?WHERE IS BRAN!??Just a thought - why didn’t Jon just send a raven from Dragonstone telling Winterfell he’s going beyond the wall? Seems amateur and ignorant, given he is their King!Back to Tyrion & Dany on the cliffs. Tyrion is such a mess-up this season it is not even funny. First, we see him concerned about Dany’s temper. Then, he walks after her kissing her ass.“The most important person in the world…”“If you’re gone, it’s all lost. Everyone, everything..”Oh, come ON! Stop this Dany worship already! The one thing Tyrion had going for himself is that he was witty. Now he’s lost even that.Back to the Wall.Extras die. Meh.Jon & co. fight a random wight-group and their leader. Sweet. Wights fall dead when the Walker dies. Expected, but thanks for the confirmation.Thoros is going to die. I can’t say I’m surprised.They are eventually trapped. And Gendry - The Flash is on his way to get a message sent to Dragonstone.The water takes forever to freeze because the NK couldn’t have frozen it himself? Or was he really waiting for the dragons?Speaking of it, why didn’t Jon & co. just hammer the ice around to keep themselves safe longer?They are surrounded. All hope is lost. But of course we knew the dragons were on their way.Dragons burn the wights down.The NK kills Viserion instead of Drogon? I guess we’ve established now that the Night King is stupid.Jon doesn’t climb Drogon. He wants to show off in front of his new ladylove (worst love story) and eventually falls into the ice. But he is obviously going to come back, so why??Oh look, he’s back. And there’s Uncle Benjen to the rescue. Where was he all this while? Doing what?Alright, Jon comes back….again.Dany finally sees the scars and the mystery is put to rest. Nice!Jon makes a move on Dany. No matter how pretty Kit looks in this scene, I swear I could’ve thrown up at the mess-up this love story is.The NK’s army somehow makes chains, and puts them around Viserion’s neck, underwater. But weren’t they scared of water or something? Anyway…Viserion opens his newly turned blue eyes. Interesting……All in all, great visual (and sound, I imagine) effects, spoiled for us by the leak. Desperate attempts to build tension are not working well anymore. But of course, the CGI is epic! To be very honest, I enjoyed the Bronn vs Drogon tension a lot more.
s07e06	Alright! I watched it.Spoilers ahead!The visual affair this episode was worth it.Until I got to the end!The hand holding and loving glances.. He even started using her nickname..Still pulling at mine own hair in frustration. At least Dear Dany is rid of asking for the bent knee over and over. That’s all I can say about these precious moments without going on a rant!Fight beyond the wall:I was hoping for something akin to Hardhome. Instead I got a lot of waiting around for Dany by both Jon’s team and the Night king’s.Daenerys was disappointing all through the episode. Apparently, I was sadder than she was when Viserion was shot down.Lots of plot armor for Jon. The Night King cares as much about him as we do. Of course he wouldn’t go for Drogon with all the living people sitting on him waiting for Jon to get on board.The actual fighting sequences with the men and the dragon’s were great of course.Tyrion and DanyTyrion is worried too much about Dany’s succession. the discussion sprouted from nowhere for me. One moment they were arguing about the Tarlys and Tyrion was begging her for a successor the next. All this successor talk.. Combine that with the ending and we might end up with a Dany n Jon baby. (Do we have to suffer through that as well?)All this discussion and I still don’t fully understand what she means by breaking and making the wheel.A cool thing I noticed. Dany was wearing the Hrakkar pelt that was Drogo’s gift.Arya and SansaThey’re laying the conflict between the sisters a bit too thick. I am not falling for it. But, Sansa is right. Arya would never have survived what Sansa did. Because unlike Sansa, survival wasn’t really her goal.Overall would not rate it more than 3/5.
s07e06	Foreword: I have a Sky subscription, I have bought a lot of official merchandise, so I support HBO, and I will continue to pay (and watch the official releases). More for Band of Brothers (one of my favourite series ever, along with Scrubs) than for GoT seasons 5 to 7, but it’s OK. So don’t tell me I should not watch a leak, a leak that has been piloted. I suspect it was to placate the pissed-off jonerys fans, to be honest. I watched because there were spoilers everywhere, so I wanted to watch it myself.Tiny little remark to all of you: a wight dragon is no ice dragon.SPOILERSAs I suspected, the fight-and-magic part makes for great television. But the writing is still terrible. The usual stupid jokes, Tormund forgetting he had just seen flaming swords (he says they don’t have fire to burn Thoros’ body…WTF? Haven’t you seen the swords?). Daenerys first includes both Jorah and Jon in a list that clearly has something to do with love, then towards the end she has forgotten Jorah. Not to mention the forced steering of the story to where the season is heading by means of teenage tropoi like “OMG both young, handsome and powerful = OMG LUUUUV”, and “OMG he almost died, so now it’s LUUUUV”.A nice effort in writing was Jon and Jorah’s conversation about Longclaw. Longclaw clearly symbolises Daenerys’ love as well. Jon says it’s actually meant for Jorah, but Jorah, after touching it and looking at it, refuses it, and even says he wishes Jon can protect himself and his children. The ultimate romantic gesture, Jorah basically thinks of his former sword protecting Daenerys and her children. The smile said it all, I think.I would even like it very much if they had built Jon and Daenerys’ “romance” better. Frankly, they still have nothing in common and are still not suited to each other, and I am curious to know what Jon will think of her choosing to execute by burning… but, hey, HBO bought the right to tell this story, and that’s what we are getting.Not to mention that nobody who is undecided between two men behaves like Daenerys does in this episode, but, once again, that’s what we are getting.Even worse than the steering towards Jonerys in the Jorah-Jon-Daenerys storyline is the - parallel - portrayal of Sansa as someone who is not “as pure as Daenerys”. Sansa is not power-hungry: she just had a different path than Arya. Those scenes were painful to watch. And, as all the “Jon over Jorah” stuff, they were meant to “convince” us that Jon luuuuvz Dany because she is pure (LOL) and will not love Sansa because she effectively rules Winterfell and has learn how to rule.Oh, and a few genius moments in writing and directing:After minutes of screen with just the suicide squad, a few red shirts appear.Wight bears attack, and, after having established in seasons of the show that fire kills them, they don’t die. Jorah has the intuition to use the dragonglass. LOL, you can’t even respect your lore?Beric and Thoros fight with flaming swords. Then Thoros dies. Jon orders him burned to avoid his raising as a wight. Suddenly, Tormund (and almost everyone else) has(have) forgotten they have fire and complains they have no fire. SERIOUSLY?Jorah is the hero, the fighter, and the mind. He has the intuition about the dragonglass, he notices they are on a lake, he suggests they try to end it by going for the Walkers. Not to mention what he has always done. Jon is the stupid one who continued advancing when it was time to fall back and flee. And yet the intention of the showrunners (as stated in the “Inside the episode”) is to show that Jon is the hero - and that’s obviously why a woman who had conflicted feelings forgets in a matter of seconds the one she knows best, the one who brought up the dragons with her, decides to ignore him completely to go mourn with a stranger. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?The things I liked: the fighting, the reveal that a Walker controls a number of wights, the alarm wight, Jorah being a badass and wanting to be a hero, the Hound.I think that is all. I hope the fantasy parts are bearable and enjoyable to watch, because I will still try to watch the show till the end.
s07e06	To be fair, a lot was expected from episode 6 of season 7 - something on par with Hardhome, an entry I consider one of the show's finest achievements. This episode felt more like a pot of stew, with a lot of ingredients, but ultimately half-cooked and unsatisfying.Alright, here's what I thought of the episode, with the proceedings in no particular order.We find the squad bickering and bantering north of the Wall, and no part of the exposition feels particularly new or informative. We then watch as the weather turns, and a wighted polar bear attacks the team and fatally wounds Thoros of Myr.We also briefly find ourselves at Dragonstone, with Tyrion and Dany discussing their subsequent meetup with Cersei and Co. There is yet another not-so-subtle exposition about how Jon is supposed to have fallen for Dany, and then talk of succession. Tyrion brings up the topic of Dany's supposed sterility and Dany waves it off, saying she'll consider the matters of succession once she actually gets to wear the crown. (The issue of Dany thinking she cannot have children is brought up again later in the episode, and this makes me think that she definitely isn't barren in the show-verse and will almost certainly conceive before the end of the show.)At Winterfell, Arya and Sansa are still at loggerheads. Arya accuses Sansa of helping the Lannisters murder their father, and Littlefinger's plans seem to be working as Sansa seemingly consults with him to discuss her fears after the heated conversation with her sibling. She later sends Lady Brienne away to King's Landing to represent her at the Dragonpit meeting, and I read this as Sansa's fear of Arya's growing fondness for and camaraderie with Brienne. I may be wrong. Sansa also discovers Arya's cache of faces. I do not know what to make of any of this - all of the friction may very well be a facade, a trap set up by the sisters for Littlefinger. We shall see.North of the Wall once more, the weather has turned pleasant again (or was it just dusk and dawn?) and the party spies a group of wights. Jon swiftly dispatches the White Walker and all of the wights conveniently drop dead, except for one (how did that happen?!) and the team rush to subdue it. The struggles draw the attention of other wights and Walkers, but then why didn't our team of heroes rush back home as soon as the job was complete? Also, Jon asks Gendry to run back to the Wall and write to Dany; why couldn't the whole team just run back to the Wall? And how fast is Raven-mail these days? The letter travels the length of an entire continent at the speed of light.Nevertheless, Dany turns up with all three dragons against Tyrion's advice, and this sequence is just not well handled and requires suspension of disbelief. The dragons do their flame-throwing for a bit and that's about it; Dany parks Drogon right in the middle of the action trying to rescue the team. Why didn't she target the group of White Walkers, considering that's what all this fuss is about? Why does she bring all three dragons, considering she needs only one for the rescue? Wouldn't it have been easier for her to control one, instead of two other riderless beasts, in the face of the unknown? Even more jarring is the fact that the Night King aims at a dragon flying overhead at a distance, when there's literally one sitting motionless just feet away. But whatever. Viserion is killed and later raised as a Wight. Jon has pretty thick plot armour as he survives dozens of wights, a trip into an icy lake, and has Uncle Benjen rescue him (and sacrifice himself in the process.)Dany and Jon later have a moment on their boat back home. Dany has just lost one of her 'children', and should be bawling her eyes out, mad with grief, but we hardly see any of that. Instead, she and Jon hold hands and he pledges fealty to her (why was that required, now that Dany has seen that the war for the Seven Kingdoms means nothing?!)The prospect of sending a team of the best fighters in Westeros to capture a wight and bring it to the mainland in order to convince its rulers of the threat seemed a pretty lame idea when it was proposed, and is, when put into action. The battle sequences are not convincing, and the ultimate rationale behind this whole thing seems to have been the claiming of a dragon by the Others as their own, to balance the equation. Let us hope all of the hard work put in by the All-Star team finds some use in the next episode and the subsequent season.
s07e06	Jon Snow is so fucking annoying! In real life he’d have been dead like 4 seasons ago. Last season Sansa warns him, Ramsay Bolton is a bastard and will do what he can to rile him up. Dude ignores her. End’s up compromising his soldiers because he can’t resist the urge to behave like an idiot. Littlefinger and company arrives just in time to save his ass. This season, he comes up with an idiotic plan to capture a wight. Conveniently stumbles across a merry bunch of white walkers. Decides not to scout and find out where the main white walker army is. Grabs one of the white walkers and suddenly the whole army is upon them. Does a smart thing, sends the young dude to run for help. Which conveniently arrives just in time to save his ass. And then he inexplicably decides to go Spartan on a bunch of white walkers giving enough time for White Walker in Chief to use his magic spear and kill one of the dragons. There’s just so many mistakes and errors of judgement that he makes that it’s a wonder anyone follows him. The writers of the show are suffering from intellectual laziness and making Jon Snow appear like a bumbling idiot. So bloody annoying!The Hound’s greatest weakness is fire. We’ve seen this time and time again. I think he’ll eventually go down in a spectacular fireball so that we know he’s conquered his fears.This season has the most plot holes in all the GOT seasons. It’s almost like the writers are tired of the show and just want to tie up all the knots whichever way they can and wrap up the show.
s07e06	Spoilers…………Great episode, minus the Night King throwing the spear. I mean come on.The Arya/Sansa stuff is interesting. It got really tense this week. In the end it's obviously going to end up with Littlefinger dead, but it's interesting. Sansa finally sees exactly how dangerous Arya has become. It's cool to see her admit that if she were going to hurt Jon, Arya would definitely kill her. She doesn't know Arya anymore.Gendry survived. Awesome, I'll sleep easier knowing that. Now all we need is his reunion with Arya and we're good.Tyrion needs to learn to quit when he's ahead. That conversation with Daenerys was going nowhere fast. If he's not careful the Tarlys won't be the only ones getting killed by a dragon.Thoros of Myr, Rest In Peace. Live by the booze, burn by the booze.Not sure why Sansa is being such a jerk to Brienne. She's absolutely right about Littlefinger.The Hound and Tormund, funny. I thought Tormund was a goner for a second. Whew. And the Hound only got people killed by throwing that rock. Really man, you're going to antagonize them?Jorah let Jon keep Longclaw. I was waiting for him to say, You keep the sword I get the girl.Redshirts down, redshirts down!Daenerys right in the nick of time. Jon being a hero. Jon being a dumb hero not getting on the dragon. Jon almost drowning. Jon almost dying. Jon being saved by Benjen. Jon getting away. Jon watching Uncle Benjen die. Jon making it to the Wall. Daenerys eyeballing Jon’s scars, yep it's true he did get stabbed in the heart.Jon agreeing to bend the knee sort of makes sense. There are bigger things going on right now. Although Daenerys should totally ignore that. Doesn't almost dying count as being under duress? They'll end up in bed together, no doubt.Wight dragon, nonsense but whatever. Things can't be perfect.
s07e06	It is now official.WINTER IS HERE .Well , on one hand its sad to see that most of what people have been predicting is coming to be 100 % true .It is a well known theory that one dragon will be converted . It is true now .Dany & Jon becoming a couple is also true .As far as the episode goes ,it was filmed quite wonderfully. It isn't easy filming such huge battle scenes ,especially creating an entire set of ice & snow .As has been going on from the beginning the penultimate episode has the biggest bang & this one had more than a bang . The fight scenes were awesome.Benjen Stark returns to save Jon and sacrifices himself which was heart wrenching .The man did not get as highlighted as he should have been.Special mention needs to be given to the banter between The Hound & Tormund . It was hilarious.The season finale has been setup well with the showdown between Sansa & Little Finger .Now im sure the much anticipated meeting between Dany ,Cersei ,Jon ,Tyrion will happen . On the whole after a damp fourth & fifth seasons this season was mostly awesome.
s07e06	This episode was pretty much terrible from start to finish. All style, no substance.Just about everything that happened north of the Wall occurred — not because it was a natural consequence of the characters’ actions, but simply because the writers felt it would be convenient (for them) if it happened that way.Consider this quote from series producer D.B. Weiss when discussing the “lake of ice” in Beyond the Wall:“We were thinking: how can you possibly survive that situation [being chased by an army of the dead]? That was the thing that was hardest for us.”It seems to me that if you’re having to manhandle the plot like this to produce a desirable outcome for your principal characters, then maybe you need to rethink your plot.Let’s review some of the more egregious offenders of this principle from Beyond the Wall:Jon leads an all-star team of main characters and no-named, red shirt wearing soldiers on a veritable suicide mission to capture a zombie.Natural Consequence: All or most of them die, including Jon.Convenient Outcome: The least important main character and all the redshirts die. All the most important characters live to fight another day.Jon and Co. stumble across some of the army of the dead.Natural Consequence: There’s too many of them, no chance of taking a zombie captive.Convenient Outcome: Only one White Walker and a handful of zombies far removed from everyone else? Easy peasy.Jon kills a White Walker, which apparently severs the connection to the zombies and turns them back into corpses.Natural Consequence: Shit! Guess we need to find another small unit of zombie soldiers to ambush.Convenient Outcome: Huzzah! Exactly one of the zombies is miraculously still animated. Now we can take it captive and complete the mission.Zombie scream alerts the rest of the army of the dead, everyone flees for their lives.Natural Consequence: Everyone dies.Convenient Outcome: There’s a rock protruding from a lake of ice, and the entire perimeter of the lake gives out when the zombies try to cross it. But not when our heroes cross it of course. Then the White Walkers decide to stand around and wait for it to frost over again instead of trying to do literally anything else. Quick: tell the people of Westeros that the solution to the White Walker invasion is: building a moat.Gendry is told to go send a raven to Daenerys.Natural Consequence: Gendry gets lost, or freezes to death, or runs out of time, but probably all of the above.Convenient Outcome: Gendry is the fastest man in the world, and the greatest navigator to boot. Thanks to Davos’ 24-hour scout service, Gendry is rescued from the cold, and supersonic ravens are dispatched to Dragonstone. Dany is ready to go at a moment’s notice, and — like the ravens — is apparently able to cross half the continent in under an hour to make it to our heroes in danger. How does she even find them without knowing their exact location? Who knows, who cares apparently (certainly not the writers).Dany shows up, Night’s King pulls out a spear, takes aim at Drogon.Natural Consequence: Dany loses her favorite dragon.Convenient Outcome: Let’s kill one of the other dragons, no one really cares about them.Jon decides to waste time fighting zombies instead of getting on the dragon, gets predictably left behind.Natural Consequence: Jon dies. Again. Maybe gets saved by one of the other dragons if we’re being charitable.Convenient Outcome: Jon’s long-lost uncle shows up out of literally nowhere to save him. Then sacrifices himself by not getting on the horse with him so we can succinctly close the loop on this plot thread, even though it would have taken all of a half second for him to get on the horse with Jon and ensure he made it back to the Wall safely.Ugh, what a mess. The Winds of Winter can’t come soon enough.
s07e06	Beyond the Wall is one of those rare hours of television that stuns you into inaction. Its biggest achievement lies in taking events that you can see coming and managing to still create moments of palpable tension from them.No One is going to harm you, dear SansaOne complaint I’ve had with the big set-piece episodes of the past — The Laws of Gods and Men, Hardhome, The Door — is that all their secondary arcs feel like underwhelming fillers. Beyond the Wall circumvents even this pitfall.In the feisty scenes at Winterfell, we get a sense of why Arya is being so mean to Sansa — she thinks Sansa is still the child of privilege that she knew back in season 1, before the two sisters separated. Unlike the audience, Arya hasn’t seen the extent to which Sansa has been tormented, and fails to appreciate the soft courage it takes to simply survive. But even though we can now understand Arya’s psyche, she is still unequivocally wrong.Littlefinger’s machinations are playing out smartly as usual. A lot of Arya fans suspect that she’s actually leading him down a trap; this feels like a twist more suited to an Abbas-Mustan film than Thrones, as we’ve got no indication so far that Arya is wise to Littlefinger’s act. Of course, all bets are off if Bran intervenes with some timely exposition that exposes our expert ex-pimp.Such is the luck of Littlefinger that even when his plans fail to materialize — like when his sinister use case for Brienne gets foiled by Sansa sending her to King’s Landing — it still serves his end goal of wanting to isolate Sansa from all her well-wishers save himself.Also, given Brienne’s history with Jaime, her presence in the capital is only going to incite further annoyance and mistrust in an already testy Cersei.First Success, then SuccessionWhen not dropping Easter eggs about Jon being Dany’s ‘little’ nephew, the events at Dragonstone feature Tyrion trying to cogently coax his queen into formulating a succession plan. It was fun watching Tyrion channel his inner B-grade management guru, even if Dany was least interested in planning for a future that didn’t feature herself.Blue Eyes ft. YoYo Night King-uhh!I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again — objectively reviewing any episode featuring the Night King is one of the most difficult jobs around (right below being the Trump administration’s Press Secretary, Communications Director and Chief Strategist).On a second viewing, a lot of suspect decision-making starts to appear — why didn’t Beric use his flaming sword to provide heat to his entourage from the start? Why didn’t he use it to melt the ice around them? Why did the wights not keep literally testing the waters and see if it had frozen? Why didn’t expert Javelin thrower Night King start launching spears at Jon&Co when they were all but sitting ducks?However, I was only able to do this nitpicking much later. The first time that I saw Beyond the Wall, I was floored by its riveting sequences, immaculate pacing and stunning visuals.The increased length of the episode lets it employ methods from the Tarantino playbook and organically build tension, as characters nonchalantly recount countless tales of yore while marching on towards life-threatening danger.The reason the episode was so compelling was that it featured a whole host of great characters that were plausibly expendable in a fight of this magnitude — The Hound could have been killed by the flaming bear from The Revenant; Gendry could have done a Pheidippides and died after reaching the Wall; Beric Dondarrion might have charged foolhardily to kill the Night King and lost his final life; Tormund could have been pulled into the water by the wights; even Jon could have drowned, only to be resurrected as the ultimate White Walker. I’ll admit the last scenario was unlikely, but I still wasn’t willing to bet on it, given that the show is supposed to end with a battle between fire and ice, and Jon’s last name is Snow.So when it was Thoros who parted company with us, I heaved a sigh of relief. Disaster averted; Dany saves the day; and all that jazz. Boy, was I wrong!Drogon being such an attention-hogging queen means that his siblings have become interchangeable to the point that I can’t definitively tell you which one it was who changed allegiance to the side of ice. However, with Jon all set to ride the other dragon beside aunt Dany, I’m willing to wager that it’s Rhaegal (named after Jon’s father, Rhaegar) who survived.The last scene between Jon and Dany was genuinely tender. Jon’s decision to pledge allegiance to Dany makes complete sense — she just saved his ass, and even Tormund is advocating that Jon swallow his pride and exalt her as the queen. Interestingly, while everyone else has been vocal about the palpable sexual chemistry at play between our Targaryens, the duo themselves have been tellingly non-committal to a point where they might yet avert the awkwardness that will undoubtedly arise when Bran reveals how they’re truly related.Complete as it was with a chilling ending of great moment, Beyond the Wall was a bonafide spectacle whose sheer scale effortlessly surpasses anything and everything that we’ve seen on television before.I presume that the next episode, much like last season’s finale, will now turn the focus to Cersei and her political pyrotechnics. And I for one, can’t wait.
s07e06	Good episode which doesn’t sacrifice its minor arcs. Long review.Let’s start with the Dragon in the room. The big fight between the Living and the Dead, or a preview at least involving new players - Dragons.The scene up north starts with all the characters exploring their common connections and pasts and chit chatting their journey away till the time they find a Wight to captureJon and Jorah bonded over their dead fathers. Jorah admitted that Ned was in the right, even though he wanted to execute him. Jon, as suspected, offered Longclaw to Jorah, who, as suspected, declined itTormund brought up Mance, his pride and what it meant to his people, to JonGendry was basically told to grow up by BwB team featuring HoundJorah admired Thoros on his charge during the Battle of PykeTormund and Hound connected over BrienneBeric and Jon connected over their experiecnes with Death and their purpose (Death is the enemy)They found their Wight, but plans seldom go as planned. So after giving instruction to Gendry (Run, Gendry, Run) to call for Dany and her dragons, the group made their stand between a frozen lake.The battle scenes were great. All the main characters contributed, slaying (??) the Wights left, right, and center and even the extras got few strokes in, before they were killed. Jon got some solo screen time as well when he mowed through the lines of Wights trying to ensure that everyone was on-board Drogon.Entry of Dragons was again impressive. It is clear that GoT producers have done their work diligently when it comes to dragons. Their arrival and destruction they can cause has been captured in glorious detail.And then came the heart wrenching part. Night King killed Viserion. It was beautifully done. It was so sad to watch him crash on ice and just slink away in the waters. It would have been even effective if we could have seen him in action before, maybe playing with his mother. The scene would have been 1000x more heart breaking. Still, I was sad, more than what I expected, watching him dieJon missed the escape along side his team and Dany but was saved by his long lost uncle Benjen. If books will not give you a closure, the show will.Night King - this dude has all the chill in the world. You just can’t faze him. Three dragons - all good, takes a spear and kills one. Then asks for another spear to kill another one. In the end, gets these huge chains and retrieves the body from water and creates his own personal Wight dragon to ride on. All this without even breaking a sweat.Jon and Dany - This is settled, if they both live, they are going to marry each other. The scene at the end was just a step short of their engagement. In the scenes prior, it was set up that they have hots for each other and in this scene they all but admitted their feelings to each other. Jon is ready to bend the knee, it doesn't matter anymore as the Queen will be on his side anyways.Special mention to Emilia who went through all the emotion in this scene convincingly. Teatful to solemn to anger to surprised to hesitant to relieved to bashful - it was all there in minutes. Good jobArya and Sansa - The scenes between them had real bite and the tension was clearly evident. By the last scene, Sansa was actually fearful of her life.Arya let out all her negative thoughts about Sansa immediately after sharing a poignant memory about their father. Arya has a lot of suppressed hate towards Sansa and it all came out in a torrent of accusations. Sansa basically just took the punches and gave back only once or twice. Shows about their characters, Sansa was ever the politician, trying to work things out, and Arya an assassin, straight and to the point.Arya’s jibe about Little Lyanna Mormont was good“Sansa - Sometimes anger make people do unfortunate things”; “Arya - Sometimes fear make people do unfortunate things, I’ll stick with Anger”Littlefinger mentioned Brienne in passing that she is honor bound to intercede if one Sister is about to harm other and the next thing you know Brienne is sent packing to King's Landing. The show is sending clear hints that Arya and Sansa will come to swords (figuratively) in next episodeAgain strongly referenced in their next scene when Sansa discovers the faces. She is scared of Arya and Arya with her creepy dialogues (I can even become you, wonder what it would feel like to be Lady of Winterfell, all I need to find out is your face) is clearly not helpingIf the show does a 180 and suddenly makes them best of sisters, I hope they do give some backstory of how their differences were resolved rather than pulling a fast oneDany and Tyrion - They get to verbally spar out some of their grievances towards each otherWhile Dany assured her trust in Tyrion, she questioned him and his loyalty on some points and Tyrion didn’t mince his words when he brought up some recent events. The scene covered the things that needed to be said from both sides. Tyrion worrying about Dany’s temper and Dany unsure about Tyrion’s clever little schemesEven after all his good intentions and advises to Dany, the parting two were not which Dany liked, for good reasons of her own - trying to discuss succession and asking her not to go to Jon’s aid“When have I lost my temper”, oh Dany, so funny“Tyrion - I plan for Long term”; “Dany - Perhaps if you would have planned for short term, we wouldn't have lost Dorne and Highgarden”All in all a solid episode with some good story building in the minor arcs as well.Image source - Mashable
s07e06	My answer will be a bit different from everyone else because I’m not doing a blow-by-blow of every scene in sequence and filling in with my commentary.Visually this episode was great. Loved the locations and camera shots. Dialog was okay but not great. HOWEVER —— the plot had so many holes in it I could drive a tractor-trailer through them.We are given wight bears near the beginning to establish that large animals can be turned into wights — something we only saw previously with horses. Setting us up for what was to come.John set a trap for that small band of wights — with no plans to capture them aside from one hood and some ropes? No—all but one of them gets destroyed. The heck? Would it not have been more effective to have means/plans for capturing more than one? Get in, get out.How did the ice king know a dragon would show up? For what other reason would he have that long ice lance? How did he know? Are the wights like the borg, where once one is assimilated the leader knows everything they know? That part was not believable.John coming back up from the water? Pleeeaaassee. He had that big cloak on and all the layers underneath, and yet, with all those wights hanging onto him, he managed to get himself back up? From freezing cold water? Nope. Don’t believe it.The wights that fell in the water …. why didn’t they come back up? The wights can walk, run, and climb. Why can’t they swim? Is it because the water is so freezing cold that they go into hibernation or what?And what is with the chains that pull the dragon back up?? HOW did the wights get those chains? They can’t be around fire — how did forge it? Where did they get the metal for the forging? WHY are they carrying around great huge bloody big chains in the first place????? And see above — if the freezing cold water puts them into hibernation and so they can’t swim out —- how did the chains get around the dragon to begin with??? HUGE plot hole right there. Makes no sense.Then the Tyrion / Danerys scene. First she seems to praise and compliment him. Then, later in the conversation (once AGAIN) she suddenly distrusts his motives. Make up your mind already! And we (once AGAIN) get a scene of her striding off to her dragon and Tyrion saying his same lines of “No, you mustn’t. If anything should happen…!!” Bleh. Give these two different lines already. And either she trusts him or she doesn’t.The writers are creating a lot of confusion and ambiguity around the Sansa/Arya relationship and it seems like they are just dragging things out to save time. I don’t like what they are doing with these two characters — they are not staying true to who they are.What — no Sam this episode? Bring back Sam and Gilly!

s07e06	The Ultimate Song of ICE & FIREIn the middle of frozen nowhere, way beyond the Wall up north, far away from home, you and five companions (one of which is dead), are stuck on a tiny rocky island. All around you surrounds a damn military of living dead ice vampires, from every which way, held back merely by an easily breakable surface of a frozen lake- until they are held back no more. They charge, getting closer by the second. What do you do? Do you live? Do you die?Hold your breath, dragon ladies and gentle wolves! Hard truths come out as she-wolves fight amongst themselves, a new explosive secret about the Army of the Dead is revealed, a longtime character parts from this world, the adrenaline explodes off the charts, a character mourns a shattering death, and the ultimate Song of Ice and Fire is sung at last- the moment we've all been waiting for (for old-time book fans, since 1996), in the insane penultimate episode before the grand season finale; Game of Thrones, Season 7, Episode 6: "Death Is the Enemy". Here we go!First things first: is the fact the sea near Eastwatch unfrozen now an inconsistency and continuity issue, or something more? It seems the plot needed the sea flowing freely, in which case why freeze it to begin with?We begin with an elegant close-up moving shot of the carved Westeros map in the Dragonstone Council Room, moving north in the direction our pack are heading to.Cut to an extremely epic shot of our seven heroes passing through the ice-cold mountains beyond the Wall.This episode is packed with hilarious and often meaningful small talks between the guys, starting right in the opening scene. Tormund praises the value of f***ing, Jon says there are no women around, to which Tormund replies: "We have to make do with what we've got" (Jon smiles in amusement while Gendry is in shock and discomfort).Jon then updates his ginger wildling friend of "the Dragon Queen" and his refusal to bend the knee. Tormund reminisce about Mance Rayder, the King Beyond the Wall who Jon himself tried persuading to bend the knee to a different, doomed king, Stannis Baratheon; Tormund asks Jon "how many of his people died for his (Mance's) pride?". I've gotta say this exchange rings uncharacteristic for me, since Tormund always admired Mance and has been his right hand man since forever, and when you think about, Mance's refusal to bend the knee had nothing to do with pride- it was a matter of principal. The Free Folk had their own lands ("kingdom" so to speak) and so do the Northerners. I don't think Jon really has any obligation to kneel before Daenerys, the North trusts him to be a king, separated from all other political cancers and the seven kingdoms games. Of course Tormund's words are meant to sway us to believe Jon is being stubborn and prideful, and that Dany is the right one here, when in fact it's the exact opposite. This dialogue foreshadows the future of this season's To Kneel Or Not To Kneel Arc, which (thank God!) will be resolved later this episode).A short, not particularly significant but nevertheless amusing, well-performed and necessary exchange between Gendry and the Brotherhood Without Banners, sees Gendry expressing his frustrations with Thoros and Beric ("you sold me to a WITCH!") only to hilariously be roasted by the Hound who practically dismisses his rightful rage as "whiny". Apply water to the burned area!Jorah and Jon finally have time for a meaningful interaction and they connect quite easily. Their conversation surrounds around their fathers initially. Both of these men knew each others' father: while Jon was the steward of Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, and admired him- Jorah would be executed if the honorable Eddard Stark had caught him. Jon loved Jorah's father. Jorah hated Jon's father (well, uncle / stepfather, of course). It's interesting to note that both Jorah and Jon think less of themselves. I didn't ever see this coming, but they resemble each other. Jon takes out Longclaw, the sword Jeor gave him, and wants to return it to his rightful owner: Jorah. But our man the Andal wouldn't take it: "I brought shame to our house. It broke my father's heart. I forfeited the right to claim this sword. It's yours. May it serve you well. And your children after you". On the obvious level, it fully fleshes out Jorah's character. It also means Jon will keep wielding Longclaw, therefore probably not the legendary sword Dawn / the Sword of the Morning (which belonged to Arthur Dayne, and many fans speculate that it is this particular sword that Azor Ahai will plunge into his beloved Nissa Nissa's heart, forging the flaming Lightbringer from it). The fact Jon will not wield Dawn (or so it seems) could either mean the prophecy is not as literal as you'd guess, OR that Jon himself will NOT become Azor Ahai reborn. I still think if he is Azor Ahai, then Ygritte was his Nissa Nissa, and Lightbringer would actually be the Night's Watch, and not an actual fiery sword. But the show's direction could very well mean Dany will be Nissa Nissa, therefore Jon will have to kill her to create Lightbringer. On a more literary note, I believe that Jorah giving up his sword has another meaning- if Longclaw is an analogy to Dany, then Jorah basically gives Jon his blessing to pursuit her.South of the Wall, at Winterfell, we get a touching family moment that turns monstrously wrong. Arya tells Sansa of one time she discreetly shot arrows, and Ned clapped his hands, and felt nothing but pride and approval of Arya's nature which is a stark (pun intended!) contrast to Westerosi society's customs. It feels like such a warm sisterly bonding moment, that what follows really saddens me: Arya says: "Now he's dead, killed by the Lannister, with your help". Sansa is baffled and shocked at this, and Arya pulls out the letter she found in Littlefinger's room in the previous episode, and reads it. It was only a matter of bloody time til Sansa's ancient past naïve and misguided choices came back to haunt her- what goes around comes around to bite you in the ass in the end. This reminds us how Season 1 Sansa really did seem to be a somewhat negative character who might betray her family, and it reminds us she lied about Joffrey hitting the Butcher's Boy, causing his and her direwolf Lady's deaths, and most importantly, telling Cersei of Ned's plan to escape King's Landing (which arguably means Sansa's actions caused his death and the demise of house Stark). Sansa tries to reason with Arya, explaining the circumstances, but Arya stubbornly and blindly refuses to understand the complexity of the situation. In a poignant moment, Sansa learns that Arya was there, near Baelor's statue at Ned's execution, all those years ago. After several verbal offences aimed at her, Sansa finally disrupts and fights back: "You should be on your knees thanking me. We're standing in Winterfell again because of me. You didn't win it back, Jon didn't win it back, he lost the Battle of the Bastards. The Knights of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me, while you were off- where- travelling the world? While you were training, I suffered things you could never imagine. You never would've survived what I survived". It is the tipping point for Sansa, and she puts in words what many people have thought for years about them: Sansa and Arya went through wildly different tragedies and journeys, and had their places been replaced, they both would never have survived what the other suffered- Sansa wouldn't be able to fight and run for her life as Arya did, and Arya would never be polite, politically correct or royal material to live through Joffrey, Littlefinger and Ramsay's abuse and manipulations as Sansa have. Anyway, back to the point, Sansa asks Arya what is she going to do with the letter, and Arya threatens to expose it to the northern lords. Their verbal duel ends with Sansa trying to calm Arya down saying she's angry, and "Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things"; Arya's response? "Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things. I'll go with anger". It was quite clear from the previous episode they were going to new lows of family feud, and it's actually very realistic and good that they vent out all of their suppressed disdain and competition that was festering their souls ever since childhood.We return to our Dream Team over the frozen lands. Another marvelous humorous dialogue ensues, this time between Sandor and Tormund. The ginger irritates the dog constantly. When Tormund is interested with Sandor's scarring, he correctly reads his true nature: "You're not really mean. You have fair eyes". The following sentences had me laughing out loud:The Hound: "Do you want to suck my dick, is that it?".Tormund: "Dick?"The Hound: "Cock"Tormund: "Dick… I like it."The Hound: "Bet you do."What's with all the gay jokes..???I think Renly, Loras and Yara wouldn't approve of this stereotypical stand-up.Anyway, the conversation continues as Tormund tells him of his infatuation with a certain tall, blonde, muscular, tough, ethical lady knight. You know, only the same woman who mortally wounded Sandor in the Season 4 finale when she literally bitten his ear off- Brienne.Next on the Talk Show round are Jon and Beric. Beric tells Jon he doesn't look much like his father ("I suppose you favor your mother"), which is ironic, because Jon resembles his real mother Lyanna and doesn't look a lot like his real father Rhaegar- luckily for him since King Robert would've killed him for it, and the person who Beric talks about (Ned) is actually not his biological father but his uncle and adoptive stepfather. After that, Beric tells Jon what he's really fighting for.Beric: "I'm not fighting for some man or woman to sit on a throne made of swords."Jon: "So what are you fighting for?"Beric: "Life. Death is the enemy. The first enemy and the last."Jon: "But we all die."Beric: "The enemy always wins… And we still need to fight him. That's all I know. You and I won't find much joy while we're here. But we can keep others alive. We can defend those who can't defend themselves."Jon: "I'm the shield that guards the realms of men…"Beric: "Maybe we don't need to understand more than that. Maybe that's enough."The Hound recognizes the mountain that looks like an arrowhead from the vision he saw in the flames in the season premiere. Does it look in any way familiar, you guys..??? That's because we've been here before. Well, maybe not physically, but mentally. This is the exact spot in Bran's vision where he saw the army of the dead, where the Night King gave him the mark on his hand, back in the season 6 episode "The Door". The gang realizes they must be getting close. I find it a little bit ridiculous that they are only following directions from "visions in flames", but never mind.The next scene jumps to the Council Room in Dragonstone, where, for once, Daenerys and Tyrion are the only two people present, and not a clusterfuck of characters (a relief). In their debating they're contemplating the nature of heroism, her impending new romantic conquest, the moral dilemmas she is facing, the complexity of securing the Iron Throne and her legacy.Dany: "Heroes do stupid things and they die. Drogo, Jorah, Daario, even this… Jon Snow. They all try to outdo each other, of who can do the stupidest and bravest thing."Tyrion: "It's interesting, the heroes you name: Drogo, Jorah, Daario, even this… Jon Snow… They all fell in love with you."Dany: "Jon Snow is not in love with me."Tyrion: "Oh, my mistake. I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance."Dany: "He's too little for me. I didn't mean-"Tyrion: "As heroes go, he is, quite little."Moving on, they discuss their future plan on how to deal with Cersei, Dany once again voices her paranoia that he is on the Lannister side, Tyrion brings up her latest impulsive temper tantrum burning the Tarlys and suddenly the tension increases:Dany: "One could be forgiven for thinking you're taking your family's side in this debate."Tyrion: "I am taking their side. You need to take your enemy's side if you're going to see things the way they do, and you need to see things the way they do if you're going to anticipate their actions, respond effectively and beat them. Which I want you to do very much because I believe in you and in the world you want to build. But the world you want to build doesn't get built all at once, probably not in a single lifetime. How do we ensure your vision endures? After you break the wheel, how do you make sure it stays broken?"Dany: "You want to know who sits on the Iron Throne after I'm dead. Is that it?"Tyrion: "You say you can't have children. But there are other ways of choosing a successor…"Dany: "We'll discuss the succession after I wear the crown."Tyrion admits he thinks they should think in the long term. After all these lectures, Dany finally speaks my thoughts when she reminds him how poorly he failed by not thinking in the short term at all: let's face it friends, for all his wisdom and amazing perceptiveness, and despite my great love for him, Season 7 Tyrion has been a walking talking miniature disaster as the Hand of the Queen. With that said, her suspicion and animosity towards him is still through the roof, and I'm suddenly wondering if maybe she isn't overreacting as I want to think, but actually truly sees into his heart. This discussion of theirs makes me predict that when all is said and done, after Dany and the entire world knows Jon's real father's identity (regardless of what may come of their romantic relationship) Dany will name Jon- her nephew- as her legal heir; which is funny since he himself has the better claim.Next, things finally starts cooking, and the action begins: a Wight bear emerges and attacks our good lads. First they kill off one of the random unnamed characters (rest in peace, Nameless Wilding #1) then it's bear on bear action (since Jorah, and the Mormonts in general, live on Bear Island and are sometimes referred to as such), and finally, after crossing paths with numerous characters, the deadly beast give mortal wounds that eventually takes a life of one minor yet old pal- Thoros. The only detrimental effect his death has, is taking away Beric's ability to come back to life- this is his last life. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, Thoros still has some small time to live.Meanwhile in Winterfell, Sansa seeks guidance and counsel in the most unreliable and untrustworthy person she could ever turn to- Petyr. A short (seemingly trivial) detail she blurts out, is that she hasn't heard from Jon in weeks. This confirms my worry that Jon has completely forgotten he is a king with responsibilities other than fighting White Walkers. Petyr proposes that Sansa should put Brienne into action- she swore a vow to protect both Stark daughters, so if any of the sisters lays hand on the other, she is sworn to intervene.Way up north, Jorah asks the dying Thoros about a battle he fought years ago during the Greyjoy Rebellion (the event that caused Theon to be taken hostage and later being raised in Winterfell with the Starks). Jorah says the Ironborn thought he was some kind of God with his flaming sword, Jorah himself says he thought he was the bravest man alive, but Thoros responds: "Just the drunkest". It's important to note that Thoros really wasn't much of a heroic figure, and his death wasn't as sacrificial and courageous as Syrio Forrel's, Hodor's, Yoren's etc. Sometimes, people's death aren't as glorious as in fairytales. And Game of Thrones is certainly no fairytale.Soon after, the gang comes face to face with wights and a White Walker for the first time in their little road trip. They set up a trap (a nicely lit bonfire to attract the dead) and then storm them. The fight intensifies. Jorah's throat is nearly choked out of breathe, but then suddenly, as Jon kills the commanding funny-looking White Walker, almost all the wights crumble to pieces. This, folks, is a great secret which means something very good: whenever you kill a White Walker you kill any Wight he ever raised with it. This explosive information means a new simple strategy is in order. Between fire, dragonglass, Valyrian steel and now this- it almost starting to look like our beloved characters can beat them! However I wouldn't be so confident, just wait until the end of this episode… A single lone Wight still stands (how incredibly and conveniently lucky) and needless to say the Fellowship binds him and drags him along. So, the hard part (catching a Wight) is over, right? All that's left to do now is to go back home… Right…?Think again.After the creature makes a shrieking, noisy signal, an alarmingly huge army of wights and walkers approaches. Jon commands Gendry to run as fast as Speedy Gonzales to send a raven calling for help. The army chases Jon and co. until they reach a small rocky island in the middle of a frozen lake, and the frozen ice surface of the lake is too fragile for the dead to approach (assumingly). They stop because the ice would break and they'd sink- apparently they can't swim, as the battle of Hardhome already implied. It seems a bit ridiculous to me: Jon said himself, the dead brings the cold, not the other way around. But their wait might have an explanation in the end of the episode. As Gendry collapses just at the gates of Eastwatch-By-the-Sea in time for Davos to rescue him and get his message, the team stands isolated on the Rock Island and surrounded from all directions. Jon and the others are positioned there for the entirety of one chilling night.Come the morning and Thoros is dead. It's nearly poetic when he- the messenger of the R'hllor, the Lord of Light, the fire God- dies freezing. Beric enflames his sword to burn his body.It was the easiest decision to kill off Thoros of Myr, the drunken Red Priest, of all the people: Jon already died once, and his final death must mean a lot and probably not occur in this season; The Hound still needs to face his brother Gregor "the Mountain" Clegane in the promising Cleganebowl; Gendry JUST returned to us so he better bear some significance; Beric should only die in order to save another important character's life, like with Lady Stoneheart from the books; although Jorah doesn't seem to have an important role other than his redemption arc, he just got cured from Greyscale, although he hasn't met his relative Lyanna yet; I guess Tormund could've died either, since his crush on Brienne isn't this crucial to the destiny of Westerosi-kind. The "bold cunt" is the least prominent character, and that's who the writers chose to eliminate, which begs the question: is the show going soft on us? So far, this entire season, no major character has died (the closest to main character to have bitten the dust by now is Lady Olenna Tyrell).Jon contemplates his options, and Beric suggests killing the Night King, since he is the one who raised all the White Walkers, so virtually it should kill the entire army for good.Sansa does the exact opposite of Littlefinger's advice: after being invited to King's Landing (which can only lead to no good) she sends Brienne and Podrick instead. This isolates her, leaving her with nobody to protect her from Littlefinger or Arya (except crippled and uncaring computer-minded Bran). Brienne's journey to King's Landing assures us an exciting and emotional reunion (and possibly a conclusion) to her and Jaime's gently hinted love story. Sansa wants to show she's independent and strong on her own. But it's was probably reverse psychology and exactly what Littlefinger planned.A short scene in Dragonstone shows Dany and her dragons leaving Tyrion behind to go help Jon, in what majestically spoils the element of surprise.The fight continues.The Hound hilariously picks one particular Wight and throws rocks at him. It's all fine and dandy until the rock lands on the surface, alerting all the army that the ice is now steady enough. Quickly the largest, most badass and blood pumping battle of the season takes place. Amidst all the action, Tormund finds himself in mortal danger, is wounded and nearly pulled underwater by wights, but the Hound saves his life. As the comrades climb upon the small cliff, and the music and photography begins to go slow motion, the obvious Deus Ex Machina momentum , and with it the most stunning and thrilling part of the episode. The following battle sequence is priceless, one of the series' most anticipated moments: the song of ice and fire, literally.Out of the blue, Dany and all her magnificent gigantic children arrive: Rhaegal, Viserion and Drogon. They burn the wights like a piece of cake, as Jon and the rest stand and stare, stunned. Dany offers Jon her hand to climb on Drogon's back, when a Wight approaches and, like all chivalrous knights, Jon turns to fight. As the fellowship (all but Jon) hop on Drogon's back and take the Wight hostage with them, the Night King takes an ice spear and aims upwards, and then… a tragedy.Viserion is shot, dives uncontrollably downwards, hits the surface of the icy lake, and drowns slowly into the water.Everybody is speechless and mortified, but none more than Dany, who just lost a child. Jon's response to the dragon's death is pure rage, as he storms wights right and left, with murderous anger pounding through his veins. As he spots another ice spear in the Night King's hand, he yells at Dany: "GO! GO, NOW, LEAVE!". As wights pull Jon underwater, possibly to drown, Dany is visibly hesitant and conflicted, but seeing the spear in the NK's arm she soars to escape. The fact the Night King has these precisely fitting weapons makes me wonder…Shortly after, Jon arises out of the freezing water (because who's ever heard of hypothermia), about to face the army all by himself, and is again very close to death's cold embrace, but as the dead approach, a hooded horse-riding figure make way with a swinging fireball, and what do you know- it's the half-dead Uncle Benjen! As a reminder, he is the Night's Watch top ranger who inspired Jon to join the Watch to begin with, disappeared back in season 1, reappeared just to save Bran and Meera in season 6, and now is reunited with Jon, finally- however brief and tragic it might be. Benjen clears the horse for Jon to ride, says there's no time for him to join him, and stalls the army, probably to his demise. Jon rides away in exhaustion. I don't know if this is the last we've seen of Benjen Stark, but God bless him. Jon has a pretty amazing family: a fierce political prodigal sister (Sansa), a warg greenseer all-knowing brother (Bran), a powerful lethal face-changing serial killer sister (Arya), a Wightslayer rider uncle (Benjen) and an impressive dragon-rider queen aunt (Dany).The Hound, Beric and Tormund put the captured Wight on a boat and part ways (for some reason). Dany and Jorah watch over the Lands of Always Winter from the Wall at Eastwatch, just in time to witness Jon's arrival. As Jon's clothes are taken off to attend his wounds, Dany finally sees the wounds from the multiple stabbing (the assassination by his Night Watch brothers in the season 5 finale) that claimed his first life- proving to her that he literally did take a knife to the heart and lived through it.Sansa sneaks in Arya's room to snoop around, terrifyingly finds her dead face-masks (CREEPY STUFF) and is busted by the little psycho herself.Arya: Back in Braavos, before I got my first face, there was a game I used to play. The Game of Faces. It's simple, I ask you a question about yourself, and you try make lies sound like the truth. If you fool me, you win. If I catch a lie, you lose. Let's play.Sansa: I don't want to play.Arya: How do you feel about Jon being king? Is there someone else you think should rule the North instead of him?Sansa: Those faces. What are they?Arya: You want to be asking? Are you sure? The Game of Faces didn't turn out so well for last person who asked me questions.Sansa: Tell me what they are!Arya: We both wanted to be other people when we were younger. You wanted to be a queen. To sit next to a handsome young king on the Iron Throne. I wanted to be a knight. To pick up a sword like father and go off to battle. Neither of us ever got to be that person, did we? The world doesn't just let girls decide what they're going to be. But I can now. With the faces I can choose. I can become someone else. Speak in their voice. Live in their skin. I can even become you. I wonder what it would feel like to wear those pretty dresses. To be the lady of Winterfell. All I need to find out… is your face.This has got to be one the most intense confrontations in the show's entire history. Is a girl finally no one? Arya's threats are jaw-dropping. I fear for both Sansa's life and Arya's soul. I gotta say, I've always preferred Arya over Sansa, but this season I've changed my mind. As partially true as some of her statements and motivations are, Arya's behavior towards Sansa is immature, childish and borderline psychotic. Sansa on the other hand just doesn't want things to escalate. Sansa is mature, grown up, opinionated and independent, clearly overcoming her past tragedies and learning. Arya seems to dwell on the past, behave stupefyingly immature and what was once a dark side and justice-motivated-revenge on mostly bad people is now openly threatening her own sister! Granted, it's probably a play to deceive Littlefinger, but I think she doesn't TELL Sansa that she doesn't mean all that... Regardless of Littlefinger's clear imminent doom, the Stark sisters' words, actions and reactions are all convincingly genuine and true. I'm not sure if Arya and Sansa's past justify this amount of rivalry, and I don't think Arya's character would do that (more clues to how it's probably a play). The fact Arya handed the dagger and just walked away is a real mindfuck, because we don't understand what is happening here. Is this a truce? A threat? A hint for Sansa to stab Littlefinger? This storyline is very unexpected, and though it's a little overdramatic and offbeat to the point I originally despised it, when I re-watched it I find it's actually a brilliant and clever plotline. Sansa seems genuinely afraid for her life. I swear if Arya kills Sansa (or vice versa) I'm rioting in the streets!By the way, though I’m not a fan of this whole Starkbowl business, I got to hand it to Maisie and Sophie- they are spot on, and their words feel true even knowing it’s probably just a coy to confuse Littlefinger.On a ship in the middle of the Narrow Sea, Jon awakens to find a tearful sad Dany sitting by him. He wishes they never went beyond the Wall, but she says she doesn't because "you have to see it to believe it". She gives him her word that they (she already thinks of him and her as a team) are going to defeat the Night King and his army. Jon thanks her and nickname her Dany (it's funny, I call her that all the time) and she reminisce the last person who called her that was her psycho brother Viserys who died burning from his Crown of Gold in season 1; so instead he calls her "my queen" and tells her he would "bend the knee, but…" which is a callback to when injured Ned said the exact same sentence to King Robert in season 1. Jon says his people will come to see Dany for what she really is. Dany then leaves him to rest. So there you have it: Jonaerys is 99.999999% coming true. I for one admit its recent development is solid, however badly I protested it. I don't like Jon bending the knee, however it might be justified by the fact she just risked her life, lost one of her children for the fight, and proved to be an important, powerful and positive ally.It ain't over 'til it's over though!The wights raise Viserion from the water and the Night King turns him into THE ICE DRAGON! Insaneeee!!! Once again the show pulled the rug from underneath us and banged our heads on the floor til we had a concussion. The fact that it is Viserion who will be used as a weapon against Dany- his mother- is intentionally symbolic, since he was named after her deranged brother Viserys. Looking back, the fact the Night King didn't just freeze the water to get to the Dream Team, had the proper weapon to kill a dragon and the chains to lift him out of the water shows that he PLANNED IT. So he is probably a greenseer, the best in the world. This might also explain why the Walkers waited for like five seasons since the Season 2 finale and barely advanced while everybody else teleported like crazy up and down and everywhere (and particularly why they didn't advance in this battle and just frozen the lake before Dany's arrival). Could Bran compete? Can the Night King just fly above the Wall now, or is the sky protected with spells as well?!The episode ends with Viserion's bright blue eye opening wide.…Episode Rating:ACTING ………….5EFFECTS ………..5PLOT ……………..4ENJOYMENT ….5ROUNDUP: …….4.75…No Cersei, no Jaime, no Bran, no Yara, no Theon, no Bronn, no Euron, no Lyanna, and still, annoyingly, no Ghost... They better be in the finale!I wouldn't say this episode topped the Rains of Castamere AKA the Red Wedding, Hardhome, or the Battle of the Bastards... The action, the interactions of characters and the impact on the story's destiny might be larger than these epic episodes, but the writing, the element of surprise and the dedication to a single plotline, lack here. But it certainly will be remembered as a game-changer, a moment in time where the plot spins 180 degrees. I'd consider forgiving the teleporting, the plot-holes, and the lack of Ghost, because the rest of the episode is brilliantly eventful, action-packed and fateful. The interactions between all our favorite characters, together on screen, were dynamite. The dialogues were (for once this season) very impressive, not George-R.-R.-Martin-good, but I'll take what I can get. Obviously it was the highlight of the entire season, as fans expected.This episode had some of the best visual and sound effects, plot-points and acting in the entire series. This time I praise many actresses and actors because the ensemble cast truly blossomed:Iain Glenn's Jorah shone through the episode and was front and center, having some of the highest number of text and not once but twice close to death (nearly choked then nearly fell off Drogon), and his reaction of sadness to the death of Viserion was even more gut-wrenchingly beautiful than Dany's, his role in the show finally gets focused which I love- and his whole performance on the show is way better than most of his cast mates, to a Shakespearean level really;Richard Dormer's Beric was always brilliant, but this episode not only gives us his awesome fire-sword swinging very best, but his effortless nuanced facial expressions which go from lightly smiling to dead serious and back in mere seconds;Maisie Williams' Arya truly manages to sell her uncontrollable rage at Sansa despite it obviously being a distraction to trap Littlefinger to death;and lastly, Emilia Clarke's Daenerys is in a rare moment of superiority in her range of emotions and performance skills, as she manages to have the simplest and purest reaction of a gut-punch with the death of her child Viserion, be stone-cold towards Tyrion at the beginning of the episode, and completely vulnerable and warm towards Jon at the end.This was easily the most enjoyable episode for me so far this season.Although the plot could've been less predictable and slightly more realistic (for instance not taking dragonglass weapons along was infantile), it has been carefully crafted to invoke intense emotions.As Thrones do best, this pre-finale episode is a heartstopper and a total knockout. All the chess pieces have fallen off the board.So many questions linger (most of which won't be resolved anytime soon presumably):• Will Arya kill Sansa- or make peace???• Will Theon save Yara???• Will Cersei join forces with her enemies??? By any chance will she become the Night Queen???• Will Jaime sober up, and fulfill his Valonquar prophecy, killing his own child in the process???• Will Tyrion stay loyal to Dany or eventually change sides???• Will Brienne choose Jaime or Tormund???• Will Gendry reunite with Arya???• Will the Hound fight the Mountain and take revenge???• Who will Beric resurrect in his final death???• Will Sam find a useful way to defeat the Night King???• Will Jorah and Lyanna Mormont ever meet???• Will Jon be Azor Ahai / the Prince that was Promised / the Last Hero, or Dany???• Will Bran be revealed as the previous Three-Eyed Raven (the one who trained him), all the historic Brandons or the Night King- and what potentially enormous influence does he have on the history of Westeros???• What is Varys' endgame???• Is Missandei a secret spy / traitor- will she betray Dany???• Will Grey Worm and the Unsullied return to Dany by season's end???• Will Melisandre's age be addressed???• Will Littlefinger's manipulations succeed, or will he die soon, probably by Arya or Sansa???• Will Dany leave the throne aside and fight the only war that matters???• Will Jon find his dynasty and be the king of the Seven Kingdoms???• Will the Westerosi people put aside their enmities (as Davos said) to combat the dead in the War for the Dawn???• Who will be the upper hand, winner of the game, sit the Iron Throne???• And most importantly- what on Earth did Podrick do to these girls?!?!My heart's racing with anticipation!By the way, though I agree on the sheer ridiculousness of the plan, the inconsistency and continuity issues, the mothefucking absurd time-warping continent-sprinting, and that the season is really a disappointment (as far as Game of Thrones go; it’s still a decent show compared to television standarts)- I still think it is a good hour of television and I personally like it better than episode 4 . While this episode fails to surpass major splendid key episodes of the past, I wouldn’t go as far as saying it was a failure. It genuinely is exciting and jaw-dropping (for the most part), and manages to deliver a great experience.
s07e06	Don’t be fooled by the following bitching, I still liked the episode.Suicide Squad Westeros style:-Seems that my bets on deaths were on the pessimistic side. Even the unnamed wildlings took a while to be ripped apart.-Lots of nice dialogue among characters.-We’ve seen some troubling timescales, but this is ridiculous. Either they stayed there for a couple weeks without freezing to death somehow or there is a bloody wormhole between the Wall and Dragonstone.-GREAT JOB JON, sure there wasn’t nothing more important at the moment than bashing some bones.-Did we just see a Benjen Ex Machina?Sister drama at Winterfell:Ok, so now Sansa isn’t just creeped by Arya but now she’s terrified.Daenerys is 14:Oh, fucking hell. Here’s how I pictured the scene:.-Daenerys: Ooooh Jon pls dont die. :’(-Jon: Oh hey. Sorry for getting your dragon killed.-Daenerys: It wasnt Drogon so its k.-Jon: Cool. Also Im gonna call you Dany from now on and as soon as I get out of bed Im gonna bend the knee if you know what i mean *wink* *wink*-Dany: *blush*.You’d think she would be at least a bit angry.
s07e06	Things don't look good in Sn 7 Episode 6.1:- Icy demonic Night King kills one of Danys' dragon Viserion & resurrects it as a ice breathing dragon under his control. It's just a matter of time between Sn 7 episode 7 & Sn 8 Episode 1 before NK, his white walkers, dead wight zombie army & his secret surprised attacking weapons(wildling giants & ice breathing dragon) attacks Castle Black and manned castles left on the Wall along with Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and The Shadow Tower. The Nightwatch & Wildings will be unprepared to fight a Night King with an ice dragon.ALL WINTER & ICY COLD HELL IS GOING TO BREAK LOOSE IN WESTEROS2:- Our favourite characters plus the dragon were killed off by the winter of the dead wights & animal bear3:- Evil/cunning/deceitful/backstabbing/smart/intelligent/heartless/manipulative/unpredictable(except 4 Bran Stark a.k.a 3 Eyed Raven who sees everything) and devilish Petyr Baelish a.k.a Littlefingers has successfully turned Stark sisters(Sansa & Arya) against each other due to the letter he intentionally left 4 Arya to find & Accuse/blame her 4 their family deaths plus the creepy scene showing Sansa's shocking discovery of the face masks from her sist Arya’s victims And the way She threatened her own to wear her sister’s face after killing her. That's horror movie creepy shit psychopath like Leatherface(Texas Chainsaw Massacr-hate these films). Poor Sansa thought her sister will kill her but instead gave her the knife she threatened with & walked away. That's good she didn't physically attacked her BUT WHY,? Was Arya Stark testing her sister to see if her suspicions are right about Sansa’s guilty of their family’s downfall. Maybe she saw innocence & victim in her eyes & spared her. What do u mean?Before I forget, Why the F+*k won't either Sansa or Arya or both confront Bran Stark(they know his gift/curse of seeing the past, present & future) to ask about Sansa getting her family killed or prove Sansa’s innocence & then expose Petyr Baelish a.k.a Littlefingers evil deeds & what he has done?Will Littlefingers manipulation & his plan 1succeeded in tearing the remaining Stark Siblings apart till there's only one Stark(Sansa) left 4 him to play mind games, deceive & manipulate in upcoming episode7?Besides saving food & supplies 4 everyone in Winterfell & northern kingdoms - Good planning, Sansa,, how exactly does Jon expected to his army & alliance to defend themselves from the Night King & a thousand or million zombie wight hordes[civilians, wildling warriors, wildlings, nightwatch guys & an ice dragon noone’s aware of (except us audiences)?They didn't built defence wall like barriers or borders between Winterfell & the wall To stop the dead from coming but we know it won't work OR back up plan to evacuate as many people as they can to the south if plans to stop the dead fails.ALL WINTER & ICY COLD HELL IS GOING TO BREAK LOOSE IN WESTEROS IN SEASON 7 FINALE & SEASON 8
s07e06	I have loved GoT, even through a mediocre season 6, and a season 7 that has so far pushed the boundaries of believability.Unfortunately S7E6 has lost me. Predictable, obvious, unrealistic (even by GoT’s standards). So much promise for the episode but so much disappointment.The CGI was incredible, the acting was good. But why the constant one-liners? Took away from a very serious build up to a serious scene, and by the time we got to that scene I had lost a little interest. This pointless dialogue about gay sex, liking dick etc was more like watching an episode of The Inbetweeners than the brilliant GoT. And then we had to struggle through a completely unbelievable and far fetched fight scene, and then we had to deal with the gushy Jon/Dany scene. And dotted in between was an obvious smattering of the Sansa/Arya/Littlefinger storyline which is dry.It left me yearning for Cersei and her bitter, twisted face.Episode 7 - redeem yourself.
s07e06	For the first time in the history of Game of Thrones, I was disappointed.After years of realisticly tragic endings where the heros do not prevail against the odds, we are supposed to believe that out of the 6 of the main characters who; venture north of the wall, get surrounded by the army of the undead, and witness a dragon killed, 5 of them survive.Headed into the episode I was sure at least, AT LEAST, 3 of the 6 would perish. But no, for the first time in the realm of the Seven Kingdoms, something unrealistic to the world of Game of Thrones occurred. And I was vastly disappointed.It was a fantastic episode. There where times when I laughed my ass off, and times when I was terrified; and, much like millions of others who will watch on Sunday, was waiting to see who would live and who would die. It delivered blow after blow up until the final credit scroll.But, unfortunately, unrealistically, and downright disappointing, only one minor character died. Everyone else survived, and Game of Thrones damaged its credibility, when it comes to what the show it truly known for.
s07e06	Legistically it makes no sense for one as they at least traveled for a day to get to the army of the dead Gendry running back would not make him get to the wall faster humans are endurance creatures and running only gets you somewhere faster if you are within running distance of said destination and depending I how long you can sprint. Gendry has no training at running marathons so I doubt he could keep a sprint for more than 20 minutes. It would take a day to get There. He also passed out upon arrival at the wall so that's another day to wake up and get a message sent. By using the gift on the map as messurement I can determine the distance between watch and dragonstone which is around 6000 miles it would take the raven a month to reach Dany assuming that dragons are say 4 times faster than a raven just to be generous it takes a week for her to reach eastwatch and who knows How long to find them so we have at least 40 days of Jon and friends sitting on a sheet I ice in the cold with nothing to eat and water that is freezing cold and unsafe to Drink as a result. Even assuming that the water was warm enough to drink let's sat Barric heated it with his flaming sword you still have the food problem Jon and crew have low vs reserves meaning that within about 3 to 4 days thier body will consume thier muscle leaving them weak and frail to slowly die in 3 weeks. The only way to survive would be by slowly eating Thoros and even he couldn't feed all 12 of them. Aside from that they had the whites go down in one hit as if they had vital organs the only ones who should have been scoring kills would be Barric Jorrah and Jon. When they fought the white walker they added a new rule that if you kill the white walker who made them then all the undead die. So Jon kills a white walker all to easily and all the undead die exept one conveniently that doesn't attack them. The group killed at least 100 undead with thier weapons Non of the characters died except For Thoros and wildling extras when I was watching the episode I felt no adrenaline past the death of Thoros it was so silly it was almost comical. The Nights king shoots a dragon thousands I feet away instead of the one prone because plot armor when he fires I at Drogon he misses because plot armor. Jon is thrown into a freezing cold lake and stays there long enough for the army to think hes dead and walk away he would have frozen to death. Then the army of the dead Chase him until Benjenxmachina right after Gendryxmachina and Dragonxmachina comes to save him and pointlessly Dies he then somehow doesn't die from hypothermia in his wet cloths and then makes it back.Arya threatens Sansa with the letter she wrote during season 1 that was written obviously under duress which Rob and luin point out immediately making it a very empty threat with no force especially since she colluded with Littlefinger to kill Cercie’s greatest allies. Arya makes cringe lines about her faces and acts as edgy as a final fantasy character. And acts like a psychopath.This episode was a load of steaming garbage
s07e06	A great spectacle of dragons, white walkers that rivalled even Michael's Bay most dramatic and explosive-ridden films in sheer visual awe. As a GoT episode though, rather negative as it lacked the political nuance, emotional depth, character development, and realism that were the hallmark of the series exciting and appealing nature. It seems that show now wishes to jump from set-piece to set-piece without consider the underlying impacts and consequences of each plot development. At least we’ll see some sort of conclusions to series though, barring a sudden change in productivity from George R.R Martin.
s07e06	There are enough great reviews as it is so I'll keep this succinct:In the stomach-churning scene where Jon & Dany hold hands and she says she'll help cause “now I see”Well shit fire lady! That's all you had to do to begin with! Really? A whole council of otherwise intelligent people all agree to send every useful person north to bring back a wight when all they had to do was fly a dragon over the wall to take a peek?! When that's what happened anyway?!The writers must be approaching this from “What plot can produce the most convenient excuse for the best CGI money can buy?”I hate that GoT is ending on sour notes.
s07e06	Why do the deads wait so long to attack Jon Snow? How come Daenerys arrive so quickly to save them? Where was the uncle Benjen hiden all this time? What was he eating, ice-cream? Did he really have to sacrifice himself?(a horse can take two people). Why the Dragon didn’t just shoot fire on the King’s Night? (I think Dany had enough time to make a quick turn and melt the ice-man). So many unaswered questions, or maybe I’m just nipticking.The episode wasn’t bad per se. It had some great moments like Daenarys starting to show his flamme towards Jon, the uncertainty of the realtion between the Stark sisters, or “spoilers alert” the perspective of an Ice-Dragon (yeah baby). But to sum up, the episode left me a little bit cold: too much time spent beyond the wall, no big surprise, the manipulation of the sisters by Little finger who nobody knows where he really stands. At least, we have that itty-bitty romance between Jon and Daenerys (if I’m not mistaken). I’ll give that episode 3 ice-spears out of 5.
s07e06	I want to like it but I just couldn't I mean it was epic in its actions and I was on the edge of my seat a few times and if it wasn't for the SPOILERS it would have been better.What I did like. The interactions between the characters, the action scenes and the setting.But the plot wasn't good. It was okay but there was a lot of lazy deusdeus ex machinas but I will get to that later.Now the plot. It was stupid for Jon to go out with only a few people. I get the logic in the plan but at the end of the day your going to try and capture one dead body from an army. They just got lucky that they found a scouting party. But I did like that but I wished they actually discussed it, have Jon say the plan is to find a scouting party or something and not just tackle the entire army on.I also feel they could probably do a better job at confirming the dead were coming. Maybe Jaime and Dany respectfully send someone they trust to go out and confirm that yer there is an army of the dead coming.If Jorah went north with Jon looked at the army and came back and said “ Yep their is an army of the dead coming and they are big”.The polar bear thing bother me. As cool as it was it made me question one thing. Why don't they have an army of polar bears beyond the wall.The free folk went pass the wall with Jon to avoid this but the animals remained, there wasn't an army of polar bears or wolfs or even dire wolfs passing the wall. I mean there has to be thousands of polar bears pass the wall unless they were hunted to extinction to the point where there was just one left to be killed and turned.Imagine having an army of polar bears or wolfs on your side. So it was cool but it raises questions.Them hiding on that island on the frozen lake scene I didn't like.Couldn't any of the dead have thrown some weapons didn't anyone have a bow and arrow.Couldn't the nights king just throw his spears and finish them off.Maybe be if they found a cave and spent a few days hiding before being caught.what I would have done is have them run across the lake have it break apart on one side but then have the group make it to the other side while the walkers run around. Give Jon group a head start and have them run into a cave system they spend a few days hiding maybe they run into a polar bear this time except a living one which is still pretty dangerous maybe even more because they don't catch fire as easily.They come out on the other side and head to the wall but then they are spotted by the whites and a chase scene happens. We get a scene similar to the Indiana scene where he is being chased and he is running to the plane screaming start the engine.In the show have the group run towards the wall edd, davos or some guard sees them stares for a moment then suddenly the dead come running out of the forest after them.Jon screaming open the gate. Now from the guard point of view they don't hear this but they see him and they open the gate but not fully just enough. They get past the gate and a few whites past the gate and are quickly killed or captured. The gates close and we see a few of the dead blow up as they touch the wood. Now this could have been explained that they can pass the wall it is just they can't touch a part of the wall.Now the deus ex machinas.Dany showing up at the last moment was epic but she got there fast.But the worst is benjen.He shows up and and dies again.This pissed me off he comes back only to die again and we are suppose to feel sad about it. But imagine this from Jon point of view.His uncle who he assumed died years ago shows up puts him on the horse and sends him off and stays behind to die.Jon has to be thinking “ what the fuck just happened ! I have so many questions “Now finally I got a lot of walking dead feeling off this some good and bad.The good walking dead feel is when we saw the people getting surrounded and thorn apart.The bad part was the fact only one named character and several background characters died.Game of thrones was known as the show where everyone was at risk so them getting away with only one real death seems off.Now I'm being hypocritical here because when tommen or tomben I forget his proper name was being dragged into the lake I wanted him to be saved I didn't want him to die but at the same time I kind of did because the red priest guy thoros or something I didn't care for him that much and he did kind of die pretty peacefully which is a lot more than what most other dead characters got.The walking dead does this a lot where side characters are killed but main characters mostly get away.Back when they were following the books I feel there was more death but now the show runners are afraid of killing people off. I would probably kill one or 2 more off just to show how dangerous this was.
s07e06	Most of the folks here pretty much gave a good review.But lets try to be a little bit realistic here. Not asking for much but seriously about 13 fighters (with fillers) going against thousands of Wights! Its not like these people have super powers.Also Jon bending the damn knee!!!??!? WTF?!?! There was no need, she already said she will help him!Anyways boatsex will surely happen next episode lol, both Jon and Dany are surely have feelings, Dany saw the knife wounds which looks fresh and not a scar!!!
s07e06	There is only one true fact about Game of Thrones, it is too vulnerable to SPOILERS. Seriously.Talking of SPOILERS, I’m sure you are worried with people spoiling GOT for you.

s07e06	I think there is a lot going on in Winterfell. Littlefinger asks Sansa to use Brienne so that she can reason with Arya. I think he wants to get the girls out of Winterfell and into Cersei's lair. For that to happen, Brienne has to die since she is going to Kings Landing instead of Sansa.Sansa in turn has to die for Arya to get the dagger back. There will be a dying and reunion scene. It will probably be Sansa putting herself in harm's way for Arya. Arya goes through self-realization and becomes a more sober and humble queen. John and Dany die anyway.
s07e06	A lot of suprisingly funny dialogue, Sandor Clegane proving that The Hound is truly dead, and Tormund finally calling Clegane on his own BS. Wonderful conversation between the men as they slog northward. Jorah + Thoros, Tormund + Sandor, Jon + Jorah… alot of character expo in those chats… and frankly I was shocked Jon didn’t at least lose a hand when he took Clegane’s (pilfered) booze away.As for the action south of the wall… I sense a Major Character Death at Winterfell soon. Arya must discover the truth about her sister, and I have a feeling she’s going to acquire a new face for just that purpose.Time is a major issue/problem because of several factors… unless someone figured out how to breed supersonic ravens and Dragon Concords… but I’m willing to give them poetic license on that.RIP Hound… You wont be missed.
s07e06	It was an episode full of amazingness.But I guess a few of those things were being awaited since the begining of this season , so there was a more of “I knew that was gonna happen ” rather than “wait, what? ”I think we all expected Danny's reaction to a be a bit more furious / upset after she lost one of her children.But that last shot with blue eyes were stunning. Can't wait for the last episode.
s07e06	It was very idiotic move to go north of the wall. I understand why they did it, but Dany could have just killed Cersei easily. I don’t know, I think it was a stupid idea only so Dany could lose a dragon and the NK could get the dragon. Also, no one died but Thoros, totally unrealistic. Someone should have died besides Viserion?
s07e06	Those dragon hauling chains in the last scene were the icing on the cake. Can you imagine the forge size needed for making those chains.Also lots of space-time travels. Somehow they have mixed up Game of thrones and Star trek this season.Danny looks gorgeous in white.
s07e06	“Beyond The Wall” was a low point in Game of Thrones’ growingly flimsy storytelling. Characters zig-zagging across Westeros at mind-boggling speeds to accelerate certain narratives was just one such frustrating defect. The high quality of writing one has come to expect has deteriorated, resulting in frustrating plot holes and many of the cast behaving out of character. The episode’s crux, the expedition beyond the Wall by several protagonists, was incredibly risky and un-calculated. The show staked too much on its large battles, allowing other aspects to suffer too much.Source: How was GOT's “Beyond the Wall” episode?
s07e06	Well, we can only comment on the last and the best scene of the episode, where the dragon opens it’s right (blue) eye.The whole scene reminded us of the time when an American chopper crash-landed in Pakistan in 2011, and the Chinese allegedly reverse-engineered the stealth technology present in it.Here’s your article link: Pakistan let China see crashed U.S. "stealth" copterWe will stop as we don’t want to cross the spoiler line, but we hope you see the parallel here :)Fidoc is a medical platform in UAE where users can discover clinics, hospitals and pharmacies.

s07e01	What is your review of Game of Thrones S7E1 (Dragonstone)?— What else I can write in review there are already some answers written in details but will add my point of view.Winter has Come!Lets start from Dragonstone, we know much fuss has been made of Dany's return to her home. Here come my favorite dialogue from Dragonstone scene in the war-room from mother of Dragons who says,"Shall we begin?"— Hell yes, let's begin.Review in Short —This is easily one of my favorite season premieres of any season (1–6) of Game of Thrones.I love that Arya killed off the entire Frey clan.In the first scene as Arya Stark took vengeance on House Frey for the Red Wedding. Her parting words: “The North Remembers” were very much a shape of things to come.Oh with this Shape of (you) lines Did you guys noticed singer Ed Sheeran along the way as a member of the Lannister army.Well, I love the humanity this episode brought to Lannister troops.Jon Snow was busy in the North preparing everyone to do battle with the White Walkers and the Night King and the deads. However, there was some major friction between Jon and Sansa Stark, which was kind of known to us.And I love that Jon held his ground against the "smart" play that Sansa wanted.And we are still waiting for Stark’s reunion as Arya is making her way to King’s Landing as she continued to tick off names on her kill list — Queen this time?Cersei Lannister seems on the backfoot as she revealed that she knew about Dany teaming up with Tyrion. Yet I'm intrigued by Cersei and Jaime's new dynamic, and the wildcard that Euron has become. This guy can do some serious damage to Dany’s plans.Jorah Mormont made a terrifying return as he thrust an arm out of his room at the Citadel and scared audiences as well as poor Sam.Let’s not forget Bran Stark and Meera, finally made it to the Wall and Castle Black.But the most interesting moment came as The Hound peers into the fire. He sees the Wall, and he sees the army of the dead passing around it near a castle by the sea. And that Beric Dondarrion could well be Azor Ahai, we all have seen the sword light up with fire in his hand in trailer 2 of GOT S7.So to conclude I’ll repeat — the same thing I said at start - this is easily one of my favorite season premieres of any season.Thanks for A2A Monu Kamble
s07e01	3/5It started off poorly but gradually got better until I stopped criticizing and just started enjoying it. The last half was excellent. Each scene of the last 30 minutes was a gem, and well-written too. I also loved the cinematography and pictures, the overall look. I am a bit weirded out about how everyone is wearing black: is that to underscore the difference between humanity and the White Walkers? It’s very un-GRRM like, but god knows everybody looks better in black.Overall, I liked it. The scene with Arya and the Lannister soldiers and the Thoros/Clegane/Dondarrion threesome were the best written original scenes the show has written in years.But overall, I feel a little less enthusiastic and excited about this season. It just feels like work. I feel like the show’s hip-factor is in decline, and while that shouldn’t affect me — it sure didn’t affect me when I got into this series — maybe it is. Perhaps I need to do another reread in order to fire up my passion.Anyway, there was a lot of “getting up to speed”in this episode, which I guess is necessary for new audience members or for audience members who don’t have good memories. I tend to be bored by that, truth be told, though GRRM does that in the books a lot too, in different ways.First scene, worst scene. I will say Arya Stark gives one HELL of a performance as Walder Frey. Not only did she look like him, she even sounded like him! I had no idea that they taught accents at the House of Black and White!! I nominate Maisie Williams for an Emmy for her perfromance as Arya Stark-as-Walder Frey. But it was so cheesy. So, so cheesy. The speech that Arya-as-Walder gave was just awful. The drinking poison; the spitting blood; Jesus. It just stank. To the high heavens. And then the horror film music again. Jesus. God. I hated it.Credits. AT this point my son came behind me and demanded to see “Despicable Me 2” so I had to pause it. I was distracted. No comment.Cut to smoke. And then Ice Zombies.Basically we’re just getting us all up to speed here. It has been a year so we have to remember what is going on. Jon in command. Check. Sanser at his side, but some hint of conflict, check. Lyanner Mormont being sassy. Check. Northern lords being completely useless. Check. Davos being — wait where was Davos?? If anything that is the biggest mystery of the show. I found Jon’s speech unimpressive and cliched. . Jon’s all like “we gotta find obsidian somewhere, it is more precious than gold and the girls are going to fight.” Idiot. Stannis told you that Dragonstone had a bunch of it.But perhaps it is necessary. They should probably subtitle this season: The Quest for Dragonglass. I thought that Sanser and Jon really should consult with each other before they have the big meeting, but then Jon pretty much tells her that afterwards. I see Sansers point vis-a-vis punishing and rewarding but then you see Alys Karstark (rather un-Arya-like) and some kid and you are all like, “Damn, Sanser, they didn’t deserve punishing. You are one cold bitch.” So it is pretty much confirmed: Derufin and Duilin are going to go down a dark road with Sanser. Now they have got her admiring Cersei? What?  I wonder if she will start sic-ing dogs on people regularly? Because that would be pretty bad ass. But I doubt it.OK, the map on the floor is cool but why the hell would you put it in a room that doesn’t have a roof? I didn’t realize that it didn’t have a roof in the trailers. I mean, the first time it rains your pretty map is going to be ruined. The scene itself checks off things: oh yeah remember how your son killed himself? Remember how we have enemies all over the place? Remember the Sand-bitches? Remember the Wicket Cunt of the West? Remember the Snarks and the Dothraki/Unsullied? Remember how we are the only Lannisters left? check, check, check, check.Urine Greyjoy really just as annoying and ineffectual as last year. But he managed to come up with a thousand ships very quickly!!! Color me impressed.. That must have had the Ironborn working 24–7! Think, you would have to pretty much create a sophiticated logging industry from scratch and then a sophisticated ship-building industry!  Why oh why did the writers write such an implausible and silly situation? Why couldn’t Yara and Theon have taken just half the fleet?  He is practically fawning all over Cersei. They have done to him what they have done to Tyrion. Things being relative. He better do some truly evil shit this season or I will throw my copy of the Forsaken (which is actually on my computer) at the screen.Sam has work study. Between emptying bowls of shit, serving soup to Maesters, shelving library books, stealing keys and books and studying into the night — I mean he’s so busy, Gilly hardly has the time to bitch at him! I can relate. I like how she wants to put Sam to bed before she even puts Little Sam to bed. Gilly is tired of Sam. But did anybody notice that everybody at the Citadel has diarrhoea? Gee, I wonder why? Maybe it’s because the guy who handles your shit also handles your food!!! And this is the intellectual cream of the crop of Westeros: letting a fat guy handle their shit and their food as part of his daily chores. And you just know he is grazing. Because he is not losing any weight, no matter how hard he works. It’s disgraceful. So…get this. Sam steals keys. Steals books. Just so he can find out the same thing that Stannis told them in Season 5. “Oh, I’ve got to tell Jon!” Jon already knows, you dipshit!!!! I’m beginning to think that the Citadel makes people stupider.I really liked the bit where they are dissecting the corpse. That was when the show started to get good. Jim Broadbent, good. Actor playing the corpse highly believable.OK, then we have that pop star scene. "He assured him that either his signature or his brains would be on this contract.” They made them an offer they couldn’t refuse. Tune in next week as Madonna plays Lady Stoneheart. But…I was thrilled to hear ‘hands of gold” set to melody. I liked it, my own melody was similar but this one is better. Now, this is when the show started to get better for me. That scene almost brought tears to my eyes: it was really well-written. It managed to hit their themes with real humanity; it was believably acted: it really managed to say a whole lot, much like that Septon’s monologue to Brienne in A Feast For Crows. It touched me. I even liked the way Arya admitted that she was going to “kill the queen” and they all laughed. Well done. And I don’t say that lightly. They are not just checking off points here. They are actually moving on with the story: Arya is heading south.I also liked the Hound’s etc scene a lot. They really know how to write the Hound, if nobody else. Banter is enjoyable. Scene with the dead family is hauting. We see Houndie as a gravedigger. Again, they are not checking off points; there is foreshadowing of something happening at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea (which is right next to Castle Black!!!)Dragonstone looked great. Much better than when Stannis was King. It was pretty grim and unimpressive then, now it is grim and impressive. Why the hell do people always stand up in boats on TV or famous paintings. Is this Dany’s “Crossing the Delaware” moment? It’s so unrealistic and impractical. Have you ever tried standing on a boat like that? But then I laughed out loud when Dany finally opened her mouth with “shall we begin?” I expected bowm-chicka-chicka bow-wow music to start up.Instead we got what we got: and the choir…I can’t be sure..but are they chanting: Fire! Fire! Daughter! Daughter! Evil! Evil! Because that is what I heard on headphones.Overall I really enjoyed the episode; particularly the second half of it as brilliant as the show gets. Looking forward to future episodes.Later this week I am heading for the non-EU wilds of Serbia and Montenegro until the 31st so I probably won’t be posting my own thoughts again until Episode 4, though I will look forward to reading others’ while abroad.
s07e01	The episode was better than I expected. I thought it would be Dany filled, but it wasn't. So hallelujah!!Here are my thoughts based on what I still remember.The opening was great. Red Wedding 2.0! As soon as I saw Walder had gathered the whole family. I knew it was happening. It was good. But it would have been much better if we didn't know Walder was Arya from season 6. Imagine the gasps and impact if you saw all the Freys die and Walder stand up and unface himself as Arya for the first time. The North indeed remembers! This leaves the Riverlands without an overlord. Who will rescue Edmure and take back Riverrun.We see the White Walkers finally marching on the Wall. Six seasons it took. Giant Wights. It was always going to happen. If it breathes, it can be turned into a Wight. I would have prefered it if they had Wight wild animals too. Shadow Cats. Direwolves. Bears. Are giant Wights their latest weapon? It wouldn't do much against fire. I can't wait to see what they have against Valyrian Steel.Bran makes it to the Wall, finally. I predicted that scene to be Meera and Bran from the 2nd trailer. Nice to see it confirmed first up. Edd Tollett seems have a major role this season. He is the de facto LC. I am not sure why he is questioning Bran if he truly is Brandon Stark. Bran didn't need to tell him past events. He could have mentioned Jon Snow. But I guess it was a preview to Bran having seen EVERYTHING. The events at the Fist happened before Bran had reached the 3EC. So Bran has been studying history through the Weirwoods.Winterfell and its men. Little Lyanna Mormont is getting more and more badass lines. It is nice. It makes the other nothern lords seem a bit incompetent though. However, it is a nice tie in with the Mormonts and their women warriors. I would prefer more input from all the northern lords. They are making Lyanna the face of the north. Where is Manderly???Alyss and Ned! Where did little Ned come from? Is he inspired by a greater part Ned Dayne may play in the books? This is where Jon’s speech of ‘for centuries our houses fought together’ happens. Many suggested it would be aimed at Dany when he goes to her as an envoy. I predicted otherwise. I assumed it would be aimed at the Valemen. Specially, the Royces. But it was aimed at northerners. So it makes sense. Jon was right to give them back their castles. Sansa had more of a southern mindset to strip Umbers and Karstarks from their castles. Her debate with Jon will be what LF will push at. He will see it as a possible weak point and a fracture between the two. I think it is way too obvious of LF to be the evil guy. Everyone is sitting and serious. He is standing in a corner with a devious smile. They might as well give him a cartoon villainous moustache so he can twirl it and go mwahahaha.I think they made Jon seem a bit of an asshole when he raised his voice at Sansa outside the great hall. I wonder if they will turn Jon into someone who gets a bit cocky with power and that will cause a fracture between he and Sansa. Sansa is turning out to be more worried about the politics of the realm and Cersei. There maybe some unresolved issues and lingering feelings from Sansa regarding Cersei. I think Sansa will be the one Stark who will turn a little dark and get busy with affairs of the realm in the books rather than the great war. She always seemed the most Southern of the Stark children. She may end up having Southern ambitions. Cersei shouldn't be a problem for the Starks if they have manned Moat Cailin. I really see this as Sansa having unresolved issues with the South which may have an effect later on. This is where Baelish comes in once again since he wants the throne. Sansa is trying her best to ignore Baelish. He seems desperate. He is no longer the confident, mocking guy he was. He seems like the desperate stalker/abusive ex bf who is looking for any chance to get the girl alone so he can blow some hot air into her ear.Look at that, Cersei made herself a map. I am not sure why the Red Keep didn't have an equivalent of the Dragonstone table until now (both in the books and the show). It would seem like a necessary thing. But here we are. Cersei's speech on where her enemies are. Jaime seems to have quite a few problems with Cersei which she is ignoring. He appears sensible, but without any ideas on what to do either. It seems like Cersei is going all out and she will go down all guns blazing.They have made Euron into more of a dick. I didn’t think that was possible. He seems drunk, unwashed, and just an absolute ass. He has come for a queen and Cersei appears to want to give him herself. Something which Jaime clearly is shocked and unhappy about. Euron is talking up a big game. Considering Cersei's track record, he may double cross her. But for now he has gone to get her a gift. Which I am betting will be that scowling shit of a character, Yarra. Euron will attack Dany's fleet as we see in the trailers, Theon will get away to Dragonstone. Euron will bring Yarra back to KL where Cersei dishes out 'Queen's Justice'. It is the 3rd episode's title. Expect a big battle in the next episode!Cersei seems like the losing side, which Euron won't choose ultimately. I wonder if he will prove his might and prowess to both sides and then make both Dany and Cersei another offer. He will want Dany to take his offer then. If Euron destroys Dany's fleet, his fleet is the only one remaining. I think the show is ignoring the Redwyn fleet. So Dany may need Euron afterall.The Frey news seems to be a surprise. Did Walder's wife go mute from fear? The Iron Throne should be aware of what went down in the Twins and who did it. If they don't know exactly who, they should know it was a northerner.Then we have Sam cleaning pots of food and eating shit. Or is it the other way around. I could not tell. But it shows the Citadel as a boring old place with boring old philosophies that do not care about the White Walkers. And then they had Sam pull out a Harry Potter thing with Jim Broadbent. The way Tom Riddle started discussing the 'restricted section' of the Library with Horace Slughorn. Marwyn in the books is absolutely into magic and eats up every word Sam tells him. This Marwyn is indifferent at best. Which makes me wonder why they brought in a Marwyn and not use any random Archmaester. Marwyn probably will have a bigger role in the subsequent episodes. I am being hopeful.Tormund and Brienne. Tormund always reminds me of Edmure Tully from the books. An older version. Brienne gets distracted by Tormund and then takes it out on poor Pod. What an asshole!If LF is truly in charge of the Vale. Why is he not having more of a say in the meetings. They make LF seem useless and a nobody. But then state that they need his men. Seems a bit confusing. The real LF would be mocking, throwing japes and causing fractures in the meetings. He would always have a back up plan that does not include Sansa.Ed Sheeran singing the song made for Tyrion. I wonder if they are using this as foreshadowing for when Jaime strangles Cersei with his golden hand because hand of gold always feels cold. But Cersei's hands will feel warm on Jaime's skin. I think this part made Arya think twice about her motives. I saw a bit of doubt on her face when Lannister soldiers welcomed and helped her with no malice. Their conversations also made her realise they are just men. Simple men. Lannister or not, they are innocent, technically. I think Arya realised that not all Lannisters are bad. Just the key power brokers. So she might spare quite a few people in her path of destruction.Arya is going to KL. I hope they do not make her the Valonqar. But her scene from the trailer maybe when she is looking for the secret passageways under the bed in the chamber of the Hand in the Red Keep. Will Arya stop in the Riverlands and rescue her uncle, Edmure, somehow? She is thrust in LSH’s role and that is what she will do. What happens with Edmure?BwB and Clegane. Boring dialogue. I thought Sandor already agreed to go north and fight the Walkers with them. Why does he need more convincing. I like the part where he burries the man and his daughter. I see this as a parallel to the elder brother burying the Hound in the books. And then the Hound turns good. This is the part where the Hound burries the dead and his old self with them. A nice touch.Sam steals books and discovers obsidian works against the Walkers and Dragonstone is filled with it. WE ALREADY KNEW THAT!! Good work, Fat Man! What was Stannis' word then, hot air? I think this is just a pre-text to having Jon go to Dragonstone and Dany for aid. They just wanted to make that obvious.Jorah healing at the Citadel? This is a bit confusing. So the maesters had the cure all along but they are not telling others? The thousands who are afflicted with Greyscale are left to suffer but Jorah gets help? A bit unfair. It would make far more sense if Jorah is not being cured, but being kept isolated in a cell so he doesn't infect others and turn mad on them. He is still waiting for the smug dragon queen.Dany arrives in Dragonstone with her entourage. Nice castle and walkway. I wonder if Mel is already at the castle. A throne appears out of no where for Dany. Dragonstone must know a true Targaryen is here. She immediately pulls down Stannis' banner. Well done, Dany. It is not like the man is gone and eliminated by others already.Overall, I enjoyed the episode. But it was my first viewing so I am not sure how I would feel viewing it the second and third time. It was certainly nice seeing little of Dany. I expect a big battle in the next episode where Euron captures Yarra. There is a wolf in the trailer for the next episode so expect an Arya and Nymeria reunion. Jon is slamming LF against a wall. It will not be Baelish revealing Jon’s parentage. It will be him trying to badmouth Sansa and create a wedge between brother and sister. I can’t wait till Bran gets more screentime. The show is ruining and failing his character. He is the key to everything so we need more of him to know history behind each event. He has to reveal the betrayal of Ned by Baelish.I was very disappointed about Oldtown and Sam. Marwyn seems indifferent at best. Sam is eating shit and cleaning food. His big discovery happend 3 seasons ago. He better find out more stuff and soon!Dany’s war council in the next episode. Everyone is offering their own opinion and wanting to strike. The dragons seem well behaved so far….well tamed. A bit convenient. I can’t wait for a Jaime-Tyrion face off. Tyrion better be nice to Jaime!!! He is the only person to ever respect Tyrion.
s07e01	(This is part review, part recap.)Well that was … pretty damn good. Better than I was anticipating, honestly.As soon as the cold open landed on Walder Frey, I knew what was going to happen. I was thinking, “Wait, they can’t … omg they ARE!!” I’m pretty sure that something similar will happen in the books, perhaps without Arya. But anyone familiar with the theory of the Red Wedding 2.0 should be feeling pretty keen now. The tension is almost unbelievable, as Walder-Arya goes down the list of atrocities as people start choking. My only quibble: It’s obvious based on what Arya said to pass along that a Stark (or someone Stark-loyal) killed the Freys. So I’m not sure why “omg the Freys are dead, wonder who did it” is a thing later on. But, yeah. Best cold open they’ve done. (It also nicely ties up Arya’s Frey pie bit from last season, when people were wondering if she killed them all or not.)Nice to see Oldtown in the credits.The actual opening of the episode, with the Others and the wight army on the march, has to set the tone for the season. It’s a great visual shot. And wight giants … you knew they had to exist, obviously, but to actually see them on the move (several of them!) is just bonkers.Nice to see Bran and Meera back on the Wall. And Edd’s cleaned up nicely! I think being LC agrees with him. I realize we need some “these are the stakes” exposition, but I’m not sure Bran needed to play psychic with Edd to prove he’s Bran (he couldn’t … say something about Jon?). I wish we’d spent more time here, with Edd asking them questions or telling them what’s happened at Winterfell.I love the Winterfell hall. It’s very democratic-looking even if it isn’t. And little Lyanna Mormont is still a freaking badass. The idea of Jon manning the Wall’s castles with wildlings is right out of the books.The Karstark/Umber dilemma, with Jon and Sansa’s push and pull, is really cool because you can see both sides. And even if you think Sansa was right, you can see Jon’s point, and vice versa. It’s a great example of complexity that can still work its way into some of these plots. Sansa’s sort-of shock at Jon pushing back at her is interesting and I wonder if this is the tension that was teased or if it will keep building up.Alys Karstark! Hi! Oh, you’re a lady and you’re packing? Carry on, m’am. And uh you too Ned, even though you were just willed out of thin air.I do like the Sansa-Jon bantering. I don’t really see it as Jon tamping down Sansa’s dissent or Sansa undermining Jon. They’re feeling each out, working out a partnership. Sansa tells Jon some harsh truths: Be smarter than Ned and Robb. Cersei’s “bow down” raven is hilarious, even though it’s obvious. We get the whole “I know her” thing from Sansa, and you wonder if Sansa really does admire Cersei, and if Sansa can learn from Cersei without becoming Cersei.Dragonstone’s not the only place with a map now, bitches! Jaime looks wary as all hell. Jaime correctly calls that Dany will land first at Dragonstone; is this meant to show Jaime’s intelligent, is it exposition or a lucky guess? “Right now, we look like the losing side.” Well yes Jaime but in GRRM’s terms that isn’t a bad thing! We get the Frey news and the “whoever killed them,” but like … wouldn’t it be obvious who did it?That looks like a red vagina on the heads of those krakens. I am just saying.OK, I think most people called Cersei and Euron’s partnership. There’s also the hint of a marriage before they meet. And here’s Euron again. Guys, I’m gonna be honest — they are not selling Euron-the-holy-shit-evil-psycho-lunatic from the books. The only thing I can think of is that they have something horrifically fucked up for him in the future to make all this “meh” worth it, as a feint. You know, sell him as a cocky douche, have people underestimate him and then BOOM FUCKING ANTICHRIST. I hope so, anyway. I am curious as to what “priceless” gift he plans to give Cersei (she returns a gift, according to the episode 3’s little synopsis, but it’s not clear that it’s this gift). I am hoping that it’s dragon-related (the dragon horn?). Also: You’d better goddamn believe Euron is still itching to actually marry Dany and will swoop in to do it or try to do it if he can.Guys. I am not a fan of Sam or the Citadel stuff in general but this editing — books, bed pans, stew bowls, all intercut together to show the monotony of Sam’s training — is remarkable. I was gagging along with him. And of course we get the restricted section, beckoning.Hi, Marwyn. I love Jim Broadbent, but Marwyn comes off as more … skeptical? … than I would have guessed. Marwyn in the books already believes in all this shit, ya know? I suppose Marwyn does eventually come around to Sam’s thinking — that the Others are real — even if he nixes the library access.Tormund giving Brienne the Eye, man. And Brienne kicking the shit out of Pod. Pedofinger is still hanging around Sansa. I also must admit, if Littlefinger succeeds in the Jon-Sansa wedging this season, I’m curious to see where it comes in, because Sansa looks pretty ready to shut him the hell down. Also: They need to keep Littlefinger handy because of the Vale knights, but it looked like the Vale knights declared for Jon. So is Littlefinger still in charge of them or not? Kind of unclear.Ed Sheeran is … not really believable as a Lannister soldier who’s survived this long. But I like this little scene. Arya sees Lannister soldiers 1. who don’t try to kill or rape her and 2. whom she doesn’t try to kill. Another lovely bit of complexity, with blurred moral edges. I did groan when Arya said she was going to King’s Landing to kill the queen. “Go north, Arya! North damn you!” (NB: There’s a wolf in the preview for next week. It’s not Ghost, and Nymeria is the only other one left. Does Arya encounter her wolf again, finally, and does doing so kick her in the gut that she needs to not go to King’s Landing and instead get up to Winterfell? Wouldn’t Arya want to go to Winterfell anyway when she learns Jon and Sansa are there?)Thoros and Sandor need to bone already. This is a bleak, bitter callback to the family Sandor and Arya encountered — Sandor was right about them, and regrets it — but the chances that Sandor and Co. would stumble onto this same exact cabin? I know, it’s a story, it’s symbolic, yada. It’s a reach. Sandor sees stuff in the fire but it isn’t anything we don’t already know. It’s all still a nice scene, contemplating religious mysteries and the meaning of life and death. Sandor burying the family is pretty poignant too and I dare say this is his actual arrival at good guy-dom.OK, so the Big Mystery Sam discovers is that Dragonstone has dragonglass. I’m very sorry but all I thought was, “… So?” This is common knowledge in the books and Stannis talks openly of mining it to help out. It’s still important but weird to see it treated as a state secret. (I’m guessing this info is what precipitates Jon going to Dragonstone to talk to Dany. Well that makes sense now at least.)EDIT: Holy shit this is a massive plot hole. Stannis already told Sam they have obsidian on Dragonstone. Why didn’t Sam investigate this earlier? Sam says Stannis told him but … why not look into it way back then?Keep your goddamn hands to yourself, Jorah.OK. Dany can, as usual, piss off and die, but this is a great sequence and beautifully shot. It’s all the better because it’s almost entirely dialogue-free. They could have done it this way or they could have written some bullshit power speech for Dany to shriek when she got there, and this way was better. Good for them. (Dany pulling down the stag banner would have had more meaning if Stannis hadn’t already been dead for a season, but what can you do?)It is funny that we have this massive empty throne room on Dragonstone that was never seen at all the entire time Stannis was there, but suddenly here it is! Almost as if Dragonstone is self-aware and knew Dany liked austere, empty throne rooms and willed the rocky chair into existence.Final thoughts: I was expecting a bit of a mess but they pleasantly surprised me. A lot of it is easy to see coming, e.g. the dragonglass is what gets Jon and Davos to Dragonstone. But there’s still enough of a mystery — What’s Euron bringing Cersei? What’s Littlefinger up to? — to keep up interest. It also definitely feels tighter narratively, by necessity no doubt, but all the same. There are several plot lines going but at least you can see where they’re going. This is catch-up but you can also see how stuff will start converging, e.g. Bran gets back to Winterfell, Sandor and Co. get North, etc. It’s going to get less far-flung. Solid opening episode — a filler, but a filler that knows where it’s going.
s07e01	Precursor: Don’t get on my back for being an unfunny smartass in the answer. It’s who I am.Overview:Very clearly, this episode was not a game changing episode, but it managed to tie up loose ends in a very effective way and set the stage for future events. Nonetheless, you can’t help but acknowledge that it was only really set ups and tie ups. It managed to very competently perform what it was trying to do, but what it was trying to do limited it from being truly great. The relatively focused nature also helped the episode, with only the core characters getting scenes. No time was wasted on minor characters like the Sand Snakes or Olenna. I was most impressed by the dialogue of this episode, since I have repeatedly called out the recent seasons’ blunt, boring dialogue, but this episode’s dialogue contains layers of meaning yet manages to be subtle, quick, and clever. The viewer is allowed to infer things on their own, as is evidenced by the masterful Hound scene. A few pointless scenes dragged down the episode, but it was a very satisfying series opener nonetheless. Transitions and visual style were very impressive. Eight out of ten overall.Complete version:A scene by scene analysis of the episode and my thoughts on each:Arya Kills Various Freys: As I said before, this was an attempt to tie things up, for which I can praise it; leaving the Riverlands with its leader assassinated and neglecting to fully resolve what occurs would have been sloppy, akin to how the state of the Stormlands were handled last season. Despite being set up, there was a definite style to this scene. Going back to my praise of the episode’s subtlety, it was a wise decision to not immediately reveal “Hey, that’s Arya”! The mystery was enticing, and could have easily been fucked up if the writers had decided differently. The dialogue was inspirational, and fairly well written, though not standout. It was very obviously a moment intended to make fans cheer “FUCK YEAH!”, but it didn’t feel forced or anything. It was fun and cathartic, but, IMO, not entirely worthy of cold open status. Being the season premiere, the first thing we see, especially if it is deemed important enough to go before the credits, should set the tone for what is to come. In Season 4, meticulously crafted visuals symbolized that this season would show the Starks at their lowest and the Lannisters at their peak.With this in mind, I feel that the marching White Walkers would have made a much better cold open; this is the season where the White Walkers attack, not where the Riverlands are flung into chaos. A minor critique, and I can easily see past it, but it was annoying on my first viewing.White Walkers are Marching: Very nice cinematography. The decision to stay with one still shot for the majority of the scene helps set the mood. It’s a very less-is-more style of camerawork, and I appreciate it. Also, letting the WWs slowly reveal themselves as they walk through the mist is a nice decision. A few seconds of letting the viewer infer. Subtlety. Also, Ice Giants. The Night’s Watch really is fucked.Bran’s Arrival at The Wall: A short scene. It shows that Bran is about to pass through the Wall. Could Dolorous Edd have made more of an effort to identify Bran? Yes. Could the showrunners have clarified why he trusts Bran simply because he knows about the WWs, when nearly everyone North of the Wall does? Yes. Could it have been addressed that the Night King’s mark eliminates magic spells? YES! Alright, so there definitely were some plot holes, but the scene was brief enough that I was able to forget soon enough. Bran is going through the Wall. I got the message the scene was trying to send, so it succeeded on some level.Jon’s Council: It is nice to see the writer’s deliver on their promise of Sansa/Jon tension, which I was worried would be underdeveloped. The writers also made the smart decision of choosing to make each of the characters’ stances in some way justifiable. If only Jon were portrayed as entirely correct, it would make Sansa into an irritant without much real effect, something we’ve all been dreading. The episode made sure to, once again, tie up any loose ends, and made a conscious effort to avoid plot holes. The Dragonglass setup is very nice, letting the viewer infer a potential Jon-Daenerys alliance. Subtle foreshadowing. Very nice. The scene also drives home the point that S7 will focus on the White Walkers. My one critique is that all of the Northern lords seemed to know that the WWs were a problem, without fully explaining how they are aware of this. Even more annoying is how, in every post-Hardhome episode, people seem to know that the head WW is called “The Night King”. HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS?! WAS HE WEARING A FUCKING NAMETAG?! Regardless, this is another good scene. Set up, but in a show-don’t-tell, let-the-viewer-make-connections type of way. Littlefinger’s stare and the appropriate musical transition to the next scene help the episode flow.Jon and Sansa: Possibly my second favorite scene in the episode. Sansa’s critique of Jon is appropriate, and helps naturally build tension. Once again, she’s just as justified as he is. The show finally acknowledges that Ned and Robb made stupid mistakes, which almost makes up for the show’s previous Robb fetish. We see that Cersei is mad at Jon, and Sansa’s little Cersei monologue perfectly describes her current personality. She wants to be respected as a leader, and to be able to be unyielding and unquestioned in her position of authority. Pretty obviously, it’s Sansa superimposing herself onto Cersei.Cersei and Euron: Seamless verbal and musical transition from one scene to another. This episode really flows. After that, this scene just go downhill. I have a lot of issues with this scene, most notably the portrayal of Jaime. In the last episode, it was reasonable to assume that he would become less dependent of Cersei’s toxic affection, but he doesn’t seem to show any negative emotions towards her. There is no explanation whatsoever of how he went from being incredibly pissed in 610 to being slightly annoyed but willing to go along with stuff now. The show has put off Jaime and Cersei’s break up for too long, and it seems like they will continue doing so. I’m even beginning to fear that it might not happen. But, moving on, we see that Cersei has invited a black magician, child-molesting yet still roguishly charming pirate to the Red Keep to make an alliance with him. Wait, sorry, that was the books. It appears that he is now an egotistical bachelor who wants to give clean deaths to two minor characters. That puts him in the top 30 best living characters in the show. I suspect that he will become worse later in the season, but he should at least be interesting and have a personality. Here, he just akwardly japes about sibling killing. He’s not formidable, he’s just an idiot saying weird shit. (Sidenote: Is anyone else reminded of Andrew Scott as Moriarty? Pilou Asbaek seems to adopt many similar mannerisms is his portrayal of Euron. I’m not saying it was intentional, but it’s an interesting thought.) Even his costume design is crappy. On the bright side, though, maybe we won’t have to deal with another Mary Sue of a villain. IMO, the show’s Ramsay fixation has really dragged down the last two seasons. Continuing, Euron says he will give Cersei a gift. (Please god… Dragonhorn. But deep down, in my heart, I know it probably won’t be a Dragonhorn :’( .) My end thoughts about this scene basically sum up to: at least the giant map is cool.Sam Cleans Shit: Sam cleans shit. Okay. What’s weird about this scene is that it doesn’t really seem to try and be funny, it’s pretty much just an excuse to show Sam cleaning shit. *Sigh*. But seriously, I’m pretty sure that a few of those shots are literally recycled. The gag sound certainly seems to be (I actually wrote some software to compare the gag sounds from the various scenes; there is no discernible difference). The bit where Sam talks with the maester is a titanic improvement from the previous bit of this scene. The whole monologue on how the world never truly ends actually made me reconsider some of what I thought about the series. It was philosophical, without being too heavy. Good writing.A Strong Grown Woman Hits a Much Smaller, Much Weaker Child due to her Violent Temper: Tormund is still in love with Brienne apparently. I’m glad that this wasn’t just dropped and was given some attention. Littlefinger is still trying to manipulate Sansa, but she’s smarter than that. I’m a little bit worried that Littlefinger will simply be unable to manipulate Sansa, and won’t have a major effect on the season. So far, he’s been set up as this scheming political mastermind, but him being beaten by Sansa, a novice with great potential, but novice nonetheless, would just rub me the wrong way. Even so, the dialogue here is some of the best in the episode. Last season’s dialogue had too many instances of people talking about fucking someone up the ass. It was unbearable. Here, we get the great Sansa line as Littlefinger exits. The dialogue is noticeably better in this episodeForced Ed Sheeran cameo: Other than Cersei, I disliked this segment most. Close to four minutes devoted to vapid conversation between Arya and some soldiers. Maybe the point was that she’s finally seeing that there are good people on the other side of the war, but that wasn’t really focused on. The scene was so pointless I actually looked it up to see if there was some inside joke, and sure enough, the whole thing was there just to set up an Ed Sheeran cameo. I didn’t even know who he was. Pointless.The Hound and Friends: Easily my favorite scene in the entire episode. The scene very competently evokes emotion without relying on shock value or gory imagery. It is emotional because you are invested in the Hound’s character and his ability to redeem himself. I was skeptical of how well the show would do this, and his proclivity towards violence even after his supposed “redemption” in 607 made me very cynical towards his arc, but this scene takes things in a different direction. Let’s start off with the Hound’s reluctance to enter the building and knowledge of what is in the building. Set up; something is off here, and we don’t know what. We anticipate a later reveal. We see a corpse of a daughter and father, and the Hound seems to know about this too. Reminder. Now, we know for sure that there will be a reveal, we’re just not sure when it will happen or what the reveal will be. The bonds with Beric and Thoros. This helps build anticipation for the payoff to the previous set up and reminder, while also being relevant on its own. The Hound is beginning to trust others and become more human. He feels remorse that the girl is dead. More anticipation. he Hound learns about the Lord of Light, and we are once again reminded of the White Walkers. I love how often the WWs are referenced in this episode. It helps establish the focus of the season. The Hound buries the father and daughter, feeling guilty. Then, payoff. Thoros comes out to talk with the Hound, and asks him if he knew these people. The Hound’s response, “Not really”, is amazing writing. You let the viewer infer. That is what is so great about this scene. Nothing is forced down the viewer’s throat. Ever. Even the funeral does not attempt to make you feel certain emotions with cheesy music or an unrealistic burst of emotion from the Hound. The viewer can feel what they want. This is why I love this scene so much. Some of the best writing on the show.Victarion Greyjoy Reference: Sam’s statements about Dragonglass on Dragonstone is yet another instance of subtle foreshadowing. It hints to the viewer know about will happen, but never forces it down your throat. This is the main strength of the episode as a whole. Next we get to see Sam cleaning shit again, but What’s this?! Jorah has signed up for treatment at the Citadel. (I would say more about the viewer inferring this, but I’m starting to realize how hypocritical of me it is to praise this yet constantly state that it’s going on. Oops.) I love the reference to the Victarion Greyjoy treatment with Moqorro, in which Moqorro burns Victarion’s arm to relieve greyscale. We then get another great verbal transition.Daenerys’ Arrival: A well filmed scene which showcases the episode’s style. Even though nonverbal scenes are frequently misused on GoT, this scene uses it to its full effect, in a perfect show-don’t-tell way to cap off the episode. The visuals are stunning and the acting is solid throughout. The last line, “Shall we begin?” and hard cut immediately afterwards is the best possible way to end the episode. (Sidenote: All of the transitions and cuts here have really impressed me. There is a definite style here, more present than it is in other GoT episodes. I used to mistrust Jeremy Podeswa for the shitstorm that was E506, but he has definitely redeemed himself in my eyes. Great work.)FINAL SCORE: 8/10- Best season opener since 201.Now, let’s keep our pants on. Just because D&D started off the season well doesn’t mean it’s destined to be great. This particular episode managed to do a lot with what it was given, but it would be very easy to fuck things up from here. Still, promising start. I have high hopes for the rest of the season.
s07e01	I thought I wanted Littlefinger dead last season - now I really want him dead.He needs putting out of my misery asap.All he does is Lurk.Littlefinger is Lurky McLurkface.Fingers crossed that when Gendry reappears with his massive hammer, his screen-time is specifically devoted to whack-a-mole-ing Littlefinger’s smug head wherever it may pop up. He could win a goldfish every time.Season seven sees the entire cast is dressed as for a Dynasty funeral c1987.Sammy-Jo Daenerys Heather Locklear Targaryen-Carrington’s tasteful mansion (the so-called ‘Dragonstone’) is surprisingly easy to break into. She’s lucky she doesn’t have squatters to be honest. I bet the Freys are feeling pretty stupid for having laid siege to Riverrun when, if they’d wanted a new swanky stronghold, they could have just walked into Dragonstone instead. Idiots.Oh, the Freys are dead? Shame.Tyrion has started how he means to go on - with his awestruck wonder-face. Dragons! Amazing! He will be spending season seven looking up and tripping over.Meanwhile, in Winterfell, Jon is giving a powerpoint presentation.Feisty tweenager, Lady Mormont, is committing her men, women, girls and boys to put on their fighting trousers and Battle for that Dawn, tho.I hate to teddy bears’ nit-pick, BUT House Mormont sent 62 men to the Battle of the Bastards - not that they weren’t appreciated, they were - add in the women, girls and boys and she’s ‘bear-ly’ got enough people for a decent sized birthday party, never mind a brutal war against the undead.The doubly weird thing is that, despite all those men dying during the Battle of the Bastards - arrow in face, axed to pieces, horse stampeded - the official body count was only three. Lots of men died, but only Rickon, the Smalljon and Wun Wun ended up dead.Oh, well.Maybe Euron will make sense this time?No, that’s not going to happen either.Here are Euron’s boats:Here is every captain on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot:Oh, and subtract Yara - so, that’s one less than not very many.I’m going to be generous and say there’s a population of 37 men on the Iron Islands. Those 37 men have built 1000 ships out of no trees whatsoever.Those 37 men are the captains of those 1000 ships and probably all the crews as well. Each Iron Islander will be captaining just over 25 ships, whilst also being at least 5 crew members on each of the 1000 ships.That’s how to do austerity.In other news, Euron’s had a haircut. I like it.The Hound calls out Thoros’ topknot and rightly so.Should The Hound survive the Battle for the Dawn, he should definitely not become the next presenter on Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.There he’d be - chop, chop, dig, dig - building a Sept with Ian MacShane and the dispossessed, or helping some poor father and his little girl to get their hovel watertight and feeling really good about himself and the world.Six months later, he goes back to film the follow-up how-they-doing to find that Ian MacShane is dangling from the end of a rope as a corpse chandelier, whilst the Smallfolk are now i) dead and ii) in small pieces.Further episodes would find him not only renovating the hovels, but also installing increasingly brutal defence systems to protect his peasants and their now adequate housing. The Hound is so tired of this shit.It makes no difference though. Not the landmines, not the Sharknadoes, not the slug-traps - every time The Hound ups his game, six months later the householders are dead regardless. It’s like they die on purpose.At least he doesn’t have a top-knot yet. That’s something.All in all, this episode felt quite disjointed and mathematically illiterate.Thanks for the A2A.
s07e01	It was pretty good. It definitely worked as a season opener in my opinion.This review (obviously) contains spoilers from the episode.—————| ARYA — We open the episode with Walder Frey hosting a feast for his family members, uncharacteristic from him. Except — what? Wasn’t he dead? Indeed, he is, and that one you see there is Arya in disguise putting her Faceless-men skills into use like we’ve never seen before to enact her revenge over the Red Wedding, poisoning each and every one of the men on the room yet sparing a girl — stopping only to tell her that when asked, she’ll simply say that winter has come for the Freys.Later, we see as she comes across some soldiers (including Ed Sheeran in a cameo whose subtlety hits you like a sledgehammer) that are fighting for the Lannisters, or something of the kind. She confesses that she’s planning to kill Cersei, but they take it as a joke. Even if it’s not, Arya heartily laughs along them, and it’s clear that she’s having a good time for the first time in a while (somehow it reminded me of Gendry but who knows what we’ll see of him?) Anyhow, the scene served as a reminder that while Westeros isn’t a clean cut black and white world by any measures, it’s not all grim — it has its moments.Will she go to King Landing’s though? Or will she change the course of her journey when she learns about —| JON & SANSA — I loved their dynamic this episode and the way they responded to each other. I felt that in some form it was very faithful & true to their character’s development, the way that their respective arcs have created meaningful differences in regards to their perception of certain situations. While Sansa is more political-minded, having grown accustomed to the ways of court, Jon takes the more practical solution to the issue. Jon does have to extol his power over Sansa when she repeatedly questions his decision in front of the other lords, and while it’s understandable, it’s also pretty frustrating.So far until now, Sansa genuinely believed they were in equal footing but as it gets more and more evident that is Jon who ultimately — much as he loves her & respects her advice — has the upper hand, it’ll make her more vulnerable to Littlefinger’s manipulations. Here’s hoping she doesn’t succumb to them. Alternately, it’s also possible that she kept voicing her disagreement before the other lords to manipulate Littlefinger into believing she’s at his mercy so that he oversteps his boundaries which will prove to be his undoing.And of course, there were some thematic parallels between Sansa and Cersei this episode, even remarked upon by Jon when he gets a letter from the new queen of Westeros that demands him to come over to King’s Landing and pledge loyalty to her. Sansa sounds like she admires Cersei, he says, and she admits that she’s learned a lot from the woman she once thought of as her future mother-in-law, which brings us to —| CERSEI & JAIMEWhat is it with siblings this episode? Similar to the pair above, Dragonstone featured some severe power disparity between brother & sister. Jaime isn’t even sure if he should fear Cersei, for starters, and repeatedly reproaches her for having killed all of their allies, glossing over their children’s death, and for believing that the Lannister dynasty — who literally consists of the two of them without Tyrion’s support — will be enough to win this war. She seems too enraptured with the mysticism of House Lannister to understand, though… until it’s revealed that she, too, has a card beneath her sleeve: access to the Greyjoy fleet in the form with an alliance (and possible marriage) to Euron Greyjoy, who promises to bring her a special gift to gain her ‘heart’ (i.e. hand in marriage). While Cersei underscores their potential as a team, it is apparent that what she really wants is to have Jaime obey her at all times. The real question is — will he? After everything? Now, I’m predicting he will for the time being but it doesn’t strike me as much of a stretch to believe that he’ll eventually get out of her grip. If he did, he wouldn’t be the only character displaying a streak of (well-intentioned) disobedience, exemplified by —| SAMWELL TARLYSo, life hasn’t been too exciting for our Sam, and his plans to become a maester in the Citadel are in progress — a slow progress, if we are being specific. After having a talk with an Archmaester (played by Jim Broadbent) about the importance of their job and how they differ to the people in the North or South, he resolves to steal the keys to a prohibited section of the library where he finds that dragonglass is one of the two materials (besides Valyrian steel) that can kill White Walkers — Jon’s got to know about this, he says to Gilly, seconds before taking out scroll and ink. Oh, and there was a Jorah cameo, his hand covered in Greyscale, who asks about his queen just in time for —| DANY & Co.We haven’t seen Dragonstone (I think) ever since the end of season 4 when Stannis left it. Too bad he, well, never returned (and neither did Shireen *sheds tear*). So what Dany finds is the deserted seat of House Targaryen. I’m not gonna lie, I appreciate the lack of Dany’s long-winded speeches in this episode, and the visually stunning, silent sequence just worked so much better. The moment was full of poignancy, regardless of whether you like Dany or not, because it’s in many forms the culmination of so many things that led up to this.Shall we begin?ADDITIONAL NOTES:Sandor’s inclusion in this episode caught me off-guard, but I enjoyed it. Watching his character develop from Joffrey’s bodyguard to this has been quite the treat. I also appreciated the nod to the books with him burying the family whose death he caused. A bit of a contrived coincidence? Sure. But it was fitting to his character’s arc, and it provided closure.Jaime got on my nerves because he doesn’t seem mad enough at Cersei for causing the particular thing he tarnished his reputation for to keep it from happening, and killing so many people. I was expecting more of a reaction, but who knows? Maybe this is some slow buildup, which will make the payoff more satisfying (not too rushed, I hope). Things are getting tighter but I enjoyed the pace of this episode — not too slow, not too fast.I’m digging Arya’s reunion with Nymeria next episode. It especially breaks my heart thinking about everything that has happened ever since they parted ways in the second episode of the series.I’m really excited about the confirmation of Jon being Lyanna and Rhaegar’s child, and the repercussion it will cause — mainly, Jon’s / Daenery’s reaction. Also Bran’s reunion with Sansa and Jon? My heart <3… and don’t get me started with Arya. (Her relationship with Jon was one of the closest in the Stark clan).Any theories on what Euron’s gift to Cersei will be? Any game-changer? Somebody’s head on a silver plater? Oh, the possibilities!
s07e01	I’m not the best at reviews, but here are some thoughts:I enjoyed it, especially Arya killing all of the Freys. I get a lot of satisfaction every time I see Freys dying. It makes me smile and warms my heart. As soon as they showed Old Walder’s face, I got a little too excited and yelled, “she’s going to poison them all!”. Yes, I am a terrible person to watch TV with. My husband talks too much, so he can’t complain.Edd looks good! I wanted more Wall time, but what can you do?Bran going through the Wall makes me nervous. I am anxious to get all of the Starks in Winterfell, but will the Mark bring down the Wall? I know it needs to come down, but I don’t want Bran to be the cause (not like what I want ever matters). If they come across on boats, I’ll be mad.Lyanna Mormont…need I say more?I have a feeling Jon and Sansa will butt heads often. While Sansa is right, Jon is too. I wonder if this will come into play later on? It is a slight to families that fought for them, but, like Jon said, those men died. The fact that they are children, makes you feel bad for siding with Sansa at first. The Others coming and needing every able bodied person is the most important thing right now.Cersei blathering on like she has a chance in hell. At least Jaime knows how screwed they are. I always think Cersei will die this season, but I’m starting to wonder if they plan on holding it off until next season.What will Euron’s gift be? I’ve wondered if it’ll be Tyrion, Olenna, Ellaria, a dragon(horn?). I doubt the latter, but who knows?Although I managed to stay away from leaked photos and plots, I keep hearing that Euron will be our next villain. I hope so! I was sorely disappointed with Euron last season. It seems they dressed him better and added some Jack Sparrow eyeliner (is this supposed to be villainous?). Lets just hope he delivers.I could have done without all the poo and gagging with Sam. I am a little disappointed with Maester Marwyn. Jim Broadbent is always great, but telling Sam that the Wall will hold? Psshhh! The end is near! Whoever goes to Dragonstone will probably be the one to tell Dany and the Gang about the White Walkers.I get gooney every time I see Tormund and Brienne. His face kills me :) “You’re a lucky man”, ha! Hilarious. I want them to get married and have giant babies.Insert creepy Littlefinger scene.I enjoyed them adding in “Hands of Gold”. Arya coming upon Lannister soldiers and figuring out that not all of them are bad, could come into play later on. To understand that these are just men who long for home but have to fight other men’s battles is important. Although I highly doubt this will happen, I wouldn’t be sad if Arya killed Cersei.I feel like Thoros should have told the Hound to burn the bodies…I also don’t think we should have wasted this much time on the scene.I’ve never liked how they made Dragonstone look. Where are all the stone dragons? Always a let down. Other than that, it was a good scene. Dany seemed awed and almost humbled that she was finally home.Next On:Nymeria!!!Jon and Littlefinger in the crypts. I had wondered if Littlefinger was going to tell Jon his parentage, something I would have been upset with, but I don’t think so. It doesn’t help Littlefinger’s end game. He wants the Iron Throne with Sansa, and if Jon is the rightful heir, how does that help?“The Mad King’s daughter will destroy the realm”. Oh, and you’ve done such a bang up job, Cersei? She’s the last person to judge somebody on their ruling skills.Steamy scenes between Yara and Ellaria, because it isn’t Game of Thrones without gratuitous sex scenes.Varys, Yara, and Theon come to Dragonstone and discuss attacking King’s Landing.Thanks for the A2A, Ananya Choubey!
s07e01	(Spoilers Galore) It was better than I expected. It did what it had to do, which was tie together all the storylines from Season 6. There were some very pleasing sections, and it was fun to watch. However, there were some glaring weaknesses (Hi, Euron), that I expect we will have to endure.Let’s start with the best:All Arya Sections: The first scene that preceded the opening credits was top notch, if not highly believable. I truly thought we were having a flashback in which Walder Frey was remembering something delightful in the 2 seconds before he met his maker. Then I realized that this was Arya as Walder, poisoning all the Frey relations. Really, that needed to happen. I remember wondering how Arya could escape with the boatload of Frey offspring that Walder loved to mention. So that got settled, and the revenge for the Red Wedding is complete.I really liked the scene with Ayra meeting the soldiers. It was nice to see the men treat her well, and offer her hospitality, and I enjoyed Ed Sheeran’s cameo. There was something really moving in how these soldiers acted like good people who were just doing a job, hating their life in King’s Landing while disliking their work in the Riverlands. It felt like Arya was meeting again with Hot Pie and Gendry in which she found some people who became part of her tribe. And her response to the question about the reason to visit King’s Landing, certainly cleared some plot issues. Cersei and Frankenmountain may face a reckoning, but I think killing Walder and his family tree will prove far easier.The Hound, Beric and Thoros: Sandor has been given a redemption arc of sorts, and he is proving to be one of the most honest men in the Seven Kingdoms. It was especially telling to see him back at the farm where he had stolen the silver and predicted the death of the man and his daughter by winter. Yes, he was proven right, and he felt bad about it. I especially liked his conversation with Beric in which he asks him why his god keeps bringing him back, when there are better people who have died and stayed dead. Of course, Beric has no idea, and the Hound wonders aloud of the usefulness of a god who cannot communicate his wishes to his followers. Then Thoros calls Sandor over, and he is granted a vision in the flames: one we already know from the Jon Snow section that may come to pass: an army of White Walkers by the sea. Why is Sandor given this ability to see into the flames? Does this foreshadow that he will serve the Lord of Light? I say yes, but perhaps not as a believer. He will fight in the Great War. Somehow the Hound’s fear of fire will dwindle as he sees the greater threat of Ice in the form of the White Walker army. That scene was well done, and I enjoyed watching the friendship between Thoros of Myr and the Hound grow as they buried the bodies of the previous dwellers.Very Good:The Jon Snow sections were well done. It was good to see Lyanna state that “I don’t need your permission to defend the North” to the lords who sat out the Battle of the Bastards. That’s right, Lyanna! We see the first squabble between Jon and Sansa. Jon wants the castles of the Karstarks and the Umbers to remain in the hands of their heirs, while Sansa believes their homes should go to loyal Northerners who supported the Stark name and grant them shelter. I agreed with Jon on this one as he made sure the two remaining heirs restated their vows as bannermen to the Starks and he clearly won their hearts. Sansa’s plan was a good one, but it may have created division among two families that had already proven themselves as mutinous. Jon will never have to worry about a Karstark or an Umber trying to hurt his cause. I also enjoyed watching Sansa and Jon argue as Jon felt undermined by Sansa’s blunt talk in front of the bannermen, while Sansa argued that Joffery never allowed for discussion and look where it got him. Then the affection between brother and sister asserted itself as Jon was hurt that she would compare him to Joffrey and she assured him he was not like Joffery at all. The conversation felt real, like two people who have been given great responsibility, and they will do right by everyone, because they understand that they have to be on good terms with each other. Jon and Sansa are already way beyond Cersei when it comes to how they establish their relationship as rulers, and I’m betting they supersede Daenerys and her circle as well.I love the interaction between Tormund and Brienne. I think he is growing on her. That is a great touch.My problem with the Jon/Sansa scenes was Littlefinger. He practically squeals his delight at trying to put a wrench in anything Jon hopes to do. There is nothing subtle about Littlefinger or the show’s need to prove to us that Littlefinger is going to be a problem. All we need is an arrow. Sansa seems unfazed by his needling, but we know he is going to do his worst fairly soon.Good:The Bran scenes were too short, but that was not unexpected as I think the show wanted to set him up at the Wall, and that is what they did. I liked watching his visions, and it was good to see him meet Doloros Edd, but I couldn’t help but wonder: why no talk of Jon Snow? Granted, this was a brief scene, but if Edd really doubted whether Bran was indeed Bran Stark, why didn’t he ask him some questions about his brother? Yes, it is necessary that Bran notes that he has seen the army of the dead as the Night’s Watch is clearly expecting them, but really, I could walk up to the Wall and say something similar. That doesn’t prove his identity. It struck me as sloppy writing in an otherwise strong scene.The Oldtown scenes were a joy to watch. I felt proud of Sam that he managed to retch but not completely throw up as he had to handle the chamber pots, weigh livers and hearts, and deal with some very ill people. It turns out that Jorah is in Oldtown, presumably getting cured from greyscale as he asks Sam about Daenerys Targaryen. ( Thank you, Kelsey !) Sam managed to get a book from the restricted section of the library that told us of the pile of dragonglass at Dragonstone, which is not only the new home of Daenerys, but a great place to find tools for fighting the White Walkers. It reacquainted us with Sam’s mission to become a maestar, plus it clearly does not look easy. I thought the speech of Archmaester Marwyn was more for us viewers as we learn about the importance of their profession, but it made me very glad that the show had casted Jim Broadbent in the role, as he is an actor that never disappoints. The setting is very well done, but I hope to see Sam succeed at becoming a maestar along with perhaps something about Rhaegar Targaryen as well.Sigh:I was very disappointed with the Cersei section. Cersei herself seemed crazy and deluded as ever—rarely does she let us down in that regard. I have put a tombstone on Jaime Lannister’s arc in the show. He has been reduced to Cersei’s errand brother who tries to talk some sense into her (we need allies, you probably have 3 kingdoms at best, we have to feed the army, we haven’t talked about Tommen). Jaime was boring, and I never thought I would write those words. Then Cersei contacts Euron, the show’s new bad guy, and wow, is he annoying. In the books, the villians get worse as in more dangerous, but in the show, they just become more irritating. Joffrey was simply brilliant and Ramsay had some fine creepy moments, but Euron reminds me of the class clown that tries too hard to be edgy and funny. He proposes to Cersei who does not want him, so he will go out and earn her hand by doing something dastardly. I am assuming he will find the Sand Snakes and Yara’s ship. Euron makes Walder Frey look like James Bond—he is just so silly in his attempt to be a badass. I don’t see this getting better.The Daenerys section was well done and thankfully at the end of the episode, as we really needed to put Westeros in order before we start contemplating the return of the Targaryens. Dany will feel right at home in Dragonstone, and I am interested in seeing how Tyrion behaves as her hand, particularly with his own siblings.No Qyburn, no Melisandre, and Frankenmountain seems about as impressed with Euron as I am. It looks like Davos is going to be Jon’s hand. I hope that the show remembers that Jaime Lannister is one of the finest book characters and does him some justice, but I won’t hold my breath.
s07e01	#699Warning: contains spoilersI just loved first episode.Episode 1 kicked off with a rare cold open, a little coda to the end of season 6 in which Arya impersonated Walder Frey using her half-completed Faceless Man training, and poisoned a substantial amount of the Frey army. It was a fun scene, although it created the potential for us all to ceaselessly question whether every single character from here on out is just Arya in disguise. It was Arya Stark in her magical mask, poisoning and erasing the Frey name, all in one wonderful swoop. What a glorious way to start off the seventh season.After the opening titles, winter billowed toward us: the Night King, legions of wights and even a few wight giants marching South. Bran was privy to this through his visions, and he and Meera finally made it to The Wall, getting the word out about the Night KingJon declared that women would be needed in the fight against the White Walkers, earning him a nod of approval from Brienne and the backing of Lyanna Mormont. There was immediate disagreement between him and Sansa, who even hinted at having sympathy with the malevolent Cersei.I watched the episode again today. When I watched it for the first time, there's a lot I missed.Upon second viewing, the meeting between Cersei and Jaime was much more telling. Cersei states directly that part of her indifference to Tommen's death was that he began to stand in her way. He “betrayed her”- showing that at this point consolidating her power was more important than her child, which was her only saving grace the first 6 seasons. Without her love for her children, she's now a total reflection of the Targaryens. In this moment, it seems clear that Jaime has realized what she is- the Mad Queen. She has no allies, cares nothing for anyone but herself, and her end goal is total domination no matter what will get her there. She talks about starting a "dynasty that will last a thousand years," but obviously this is impossible. She presumably can't have any more children, so who would carry on this supposed dynasty? It's not what she's really after at this point. As she said to Littlefinger in (I believe) season 2, “power is power” - it is all she cares about now. Her damning observations about all the "whores" in power in every direction is a keen reflection of what she really is- she has done everything she is accusing them of with no real basis for it.Cersei's interaction with Euron is also very interesting. During their conversation, Euron mirrors the exact mindset that Cersei has in reconquering Westeros. She will kill because it suits her goals, she will marry if it suits her goals, she will carry no desire for revenge that does not suit her goal. Euron is reflecting the image she wants Jaime to be. Euron and Cersei are effectively the same at this point, the twin that Jaime never was, not truly. What he will decide to do after observing this will be interesting to say the least.Finally, Sandor's conversation with Beric is not so much a real conversation or accusation centered around the point of why he was chosen to be alive when other, better people are dead. This conversation was really the monologue that Sandor is having with himself. He's sitting in the cabin of people he helped bring to their grave, literally with their corpses around him. He's really asking, "why am I alive? Why I am continually “brought back?” He almost died a thousand times. Why are “the gods” continually saving him when even he doesn't fully believe he still deserves to live? Beric's answer to his questions says it all- he doesn't know. At this point, Beric and Sandor are reflections of one another.Just a few more observations.I will not punish sons and daughters for the crimes of their fathers.That's so in character for Jon given how much Catelyn hated him as a kid for being a bastard when it was never his fault.Jon has come so far, and literally back from the dead, but his transformation from boy to man, from commander to king, is just incredible, and Kit is killing it.Anyone else see Littlefinger's dagger in the book Sam was reading?. And I was only able to make out the name “Aegon” I'm sure there are plenty of interesting facts on that pageAnybody who played the “drink every time someone dies,” game got fucked real quick this episode.I like that we've reached the point where Arya encounters a group of Lannister soldiers and I'm genuinely afraid for the Lannisters.“Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe” I love that whole scene. House frey is gone forever.Welcome to the Citadel Sam. Poop and soup.That scene with Sam asking the grand maester to have access to the restricted section of the library was Harry Potter dejavu with Tom Riddle asking Slughorn about the restricted section of the library (same actor)Did anyone else catch the brief use of the Khal Drogo/Dany love theme from season 1-2? It plays as she first sets foot on dragonstone's shore. Loving the use of leitmotif in this show. That theme is distinct from the usual targaryan theme and the dragons' theme. It is specific to her relationship with Drogo and hasn't played since her vision in season 2, but without using words, the music tells us she is remembering Drogo's promise of the seven kingdoms.Arya with one of the best lines of the series: “Tell them, winter came for House Frey”Overall, This was easily one of my favorite season premieres of any season of Game of Thrones. It's a testament to the show's staying power and quality that even this far in, a season's first episode could be so good.Madhav Matle
s07e01	I thought it was good.Good things first.“Arya’s” speech before the Freys was great. (David Bradley’s swansong performance was perfect!) That was a nice touch. Bad things: can the faceless men totally mimic their stolen face person to match their physique? It would have been better if Arya/Walder Frey had made her speech sitting down. Just a small thing…. anyhow.Bad thing. Sam is the piss-pot boy. OK. So he’s got the piss cleaning job. That scene went on for way too long. We’ve got only 7 episodes and the show’s writers/directors spend XX minutes showing Sam cleaning out shit from pots. Thinking about it makes me want to hurl. I don’t want to time it but it went on for ages. Did the writers’ have to rub it in??? Good thing: Sam and Professor Slughorn discuss the restricted area in the library which was a reference to the Harry Potter films.Euron the Comedian. This guy should go on tour in Westeros. He’d kill them all for sure. His song and dance trying to woo Cersei was hilarious. His dig at Jamie was sheer brilliance.Arya meets Ed Sheeran and his merry band. Some people found it cringy. I liked it. I thought they could have played more on Arya the killer theme. One of the worst nightmares I ever had as a boy was dreaming about a scene in WW2. In it I was a soldier in a small hut somewhere in Russia when one of our troop brought in a prisoner. Our cook a friendly dopey sort of guy had made this great egg and bacon breakfast. And he invited the prisoner who was cold to sit down and have a meal with us. Things were going well, the cook was smiley and laughing. I even cracked a smile. The prisoner was really enjoying the meal and eating the bacon with gusto from his plate. Then out of nowhere he uses the fork to stab the cook in the throat or eye. Then all hell broke loose. I think he stabbed me with a butter knife. I’m not saying they should have had Arya kill Ed Sheeran’s character. But they could have played that tension all the way to the end.
s07e01	7/10. A decent episode, but far from being one of the very good. Its overall problems were the absence of any good dialogue scene and the pace (some things happened without much built-up and others took too long for no good reason).Red Wedding II was good, one of the strongest moments. I liked that Arya didn’t go full “girl power” or smug; that was serious business. The wolf and the sheep metaphor was great: the Starks need to remind us that they are also dangerous, not only honorable, and winter is their time after all.I liked the scene with Arya and the Lannister soldiers; those who say it didn’t add anything to the plot should better think again. It reminded us of two key ideas of Martin’s works: (a) there are no absolutely “good” and “bad” factions as a whole (I think the scene mirrors and reverses the one in season 3 where Brienne killed three Stark soldiers for torturing and hanging three women who served the Lannisters); (b) the smallfolk suffer against their will, because of the high lords and kings. It was a touching, human moment.The army of the dead was a powerful and chilling scene. Giant wights confirmed.Meera and Bran at the Wall was a bit lukewarm. “Why should I believe you?” “I saw the Night King.” “OK.” I’d like to hear something about Jon and see all three of them show more emotion. As far as I know, everyone thought Bran was dead.The tension between Jon and Sansa is quite good; it’s clear they play on different fields, i.e. saving humanity vs. politics. Neither of them is completely unjustified, but in the long term Jon’s plans make more sense and it’s his destiny to try to persuade people who don’t realize the real stakes.Little Ned and Alys swearing fealty is the show’s way of making up for the pathetic “The North forgets” we saw in seasons 5 and 6—I will never forget, though. Sansa’s talking of Joffrey out of the blue and then taking it back was a bit weird and clumsy. The show runners have obviously decided to raise the tone of this disagreement too soon and too much, for lack of any other political intrigue.Cersei has gone all smug, and I don’t like it so much—enough is enough. Nikolaj was great as Jaime; his comments about food supply etc. are the most political thing we’ve seen lately.I’m terribly disappointed with swag Euron; I hoped D&D would have realized how wrongly he was portrayed in season 6, but he had no “dark grace” whatsoever (his dick jokes simply became hand jokes). I’m afraid there’s no way for him to become even the shade of the terrifying individual he is in the books.I can’t understand the Citadel plot (not to mention that I found the montage at the beginning to be too long and stomach-turning). Are we supposed to believe that the maesters are stupid enough to compare Robert’s Rebellion with the coming of the Others? For six seasons, spreading the news about the invasion was all that mattered for the Watch; now that the maesters know, they still don’t give a sh*t (no pun intended).The whole restricted section thing was so clichéd (the hero takes one book and finds a clear answer there) and Harry Potter-esque, I expected Walder Frey (aka Argus Filch) to catch Sam. And, of course, how is it possible for Sam to forget his most important discussion with Stannis, only to remember it now that Jon and Dany have to meet? Stupid and too convenient.Sandor and the BwB had some nice moments. It’s good to see Sandor try to both suppress and express his feelings. You could see how a whole life as a soldier has made him stiff, but you know there’s a kind heart deep inside. His realization that the man and girl he met a few seasons ago committed suicide progresses his character in a subtle and touching way that is akin to Game of Thrones.Sandor’s vision in the fire came a bit out of the blue, but was chilling and it’s obviously a foreshadowing for whatever is going to happen near Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.Daenerys’ coming to Dragonstone left me stone-faced. I didn’t feel anything, and now I’m certain Darth Vader’s mask is more expressive than Emilia Clarke. The dragons flying was great (note I don’t like them very much), but the scene on earth was mediocre, to say the least. No resolve, no real emotion. What are we supposed to get? Relief? Happiness? Resoluteness? Tyrion keeping standing in her shadow, and I don’t like that. Where is the independent, free-spirited person we loved?
s07e01	I was eagerly waiting for Game of Thrones to return ever since Cersei blew up the Sept and Danaerys set sail to Westeros in Season 6 Finale. But does this episode live up to this hype? The answer is not a strict yes or no. Instead, this premiere marked a Topsy - turvy start to the season.Although nothing eventful happens in season premieres, but considering the reduced episode count for this season, this premiere should have been action packed. It had its moments - humour, revenge, remorse but the narrative momentum never attained a desirable pace. The starting sequence of Arya's revenge increased the hype manifold and as soon as the opening theme started, I couldn't wait anymore. But again, the episode didn't really take off.The scenes at King's landing - Cersei and Jaime realizing their odds in the war to come, Euron Greyjoy's entry and his proposal to Cersie - were well enacted and laid a foundation to an alliance to be witnessed in the war. Things started going downhill when Euron left promising to return with a "gift" (This was really predictable). Then we see Sam cleaning "pots", having weird meals, sorting books and weighing organs. The editing in this part was on point and prevented the scene from seeming out of place. I, honestly, would be happy if Sam did not return for further scenes in the same episode. But, nah. Another scene where Sam gets "access" to the restricted area in the library and him finding out important information about dragon-glass, seemed rushed and I think, was not necessary to be shown in the premiere. Maybe this would have been more appropriate in the next episode?!Also, Jorah Mormont is at the Citadel locked in a room. He extends his arm out of a small window just to ask if Dany has reached Westeros. This was weird and honestly, disappointing. Also, there is a rather long sequence of Hound with BWB (Brotherhood without banners) where they find a suitable place to rest for the chilly night. The sequence was really long (about 10 minutes long) where certain things happened (all of which, IMO, has little to no impact on the overall story). It seemed rather unnecessary and just for the sake of giving a certain depth to Hound's character but there is just not enough time (and need) for this.Also, Ed Sheeran's cameo scene is strangely humorous and weird and feels out of place. It is also uncomfortably long and feels rather forced. The last six minutes are devoted to Danaerys and her allies arriving at Dragonstone. Emilia Clarke had one dialogue throughout the scene but she was supposed to (at least) show some emotion as she arrived at her ancestral home. Like, why is she so expressionless?The biggest complaint I have with this episode is its editing. Why didn't they edit some unnecessary long sequences to accommodate sequences of other characters who weren't shown in the premiere at all (Melisandre, Olena Tyrell, Sand Snakes, even Bran and Meera were just shown arriving at Castle Black). A huge chunk of time was devoted to Sam, Arya and Hound & BWB. A crisp editing would have enabled about 15 minutes to spare on other characters as well which were absent. Even Jon is given a mere 5 minutes of screen time but he shines (as always). A brief argument (disagreement?) between him and Sansa and littlefinger's smirk really set up the political disturbance yet to be experienced at Winterfell. Tyrion Lannister (one of the most important characters) had (close to) no screen time, no dialogues. Another problem is that this episode was largely predictable and nothing (big) actually happened.So all in all, it was a largely average episode (bad, considering the standards set by the series) which had its moments. But that's it. A large portion of it was some unnecessary stuff which nobody really cares about.
s07e01	I thought it was a reasonably good first episode. It showed where everyone was. It has done the expected job of setting up the season. I really hope things move fast given that this season has only 7 episodes and there are no filler episodes.What I loved:The opening. I will admit I was confused when I first saw Walder and a hint of doubt crept in when he asked the wife to not drink the wine. Sort of confirmed when he started berating his men after they took their first drink. It was a good opening. I also liked Arya’s interaction with the Lannister soldiers. The poor man who can’t see his new-born, wish it was a girl. Especially a nice touch given they were Lannister men.Seeing the Night King’s Army was a badass moment. Giants!! Westeros is royally screwed if they don’t have a solid plan.The Winterfell scenes were well done. I wish Jon had been a little polite with Sansa and Sansa had shown more sense by not confronting Jon in the open. It was a bit immature from both of them and it might make things a little complex. I really wish Jon hadn’t said “by listening to you?” that was dumb. Why Jon? Why would you not want to listen to her and consider what she has to say? I felt Jon did the right thing with Karstarks and Umbers, but they could have handled it better. Davos, being the Hand and a more level-headed person should have intervened and asked them to chill and taken the conversation offline.The scenes involving the Brotherhood were great too. Sandor is exposing more and more of what kind of a person he is on the inside. The grave digging scene was a very nice touch.What I liked:Dragonstone landing! Minimal dialogue. The grandeur of the castle. The throne room, the map table. “Shall we begin?” (What, no nap? No coffee? Straight to business!)Sansa asking “What do you want Lord Baelish?” and him replying “Be happy, be safe” is becoming a bit redundant now. They should stop talking to each other unless there is something important. Tormund-Brienne is picking up. I like their interactions. Can’t believe there was a time when I didn’t like Tormund.Oldtown! Firstly, loved seeing it in the opening credits. It looked great. Is Broadbent playing Marwyn? Sam only addresses him as Archmaester, so not sure if they have revealed his name. Looks like he might believe in the Whitewalker threat. Although, for now it looks like he thinks they are safe behind the Wall. One major gripe I had here was how easy it was to steal they keys to a restricted section! You would think one would keep the keys more secure if the content in there was so precious, no? Yes Jorah, your queen is here. Do try not to touch people please, thank you.What I did not like:They are continuing to screw with a character I love from the books: Jaime Lannister. Whenever they show him being puppet to Cersei on screen, I comfort myself by imagining Jaime tearing up Cersei’s letter in the Riverlands and console myself.I don’t even want to start talking about Euron. You are supposed to tremble and piss in your pants when you see/hear about Euron. What is this shit “I will give you a gift, please marry me” shitty version of him?Bran and Edd. What I am not very clear about here is this: Edd can clearly see the two of them are humans and not wights. What does it matter if they are wildlings or not? Haven’t you already decided that you bring any humans to your side? And Bran to prove who he is, he says he saw a vision? Why should Edd even trust what he says? Why not talk about Jon? Sheesh. Happy Bran is back at the wall though.Looking forward to “Stormborn” and hoping things pick up fairly quickly!!
s07e01	AN AMAZING BEGINNING (spoilers ahead )The season 7 of GoT kicked off amazingly and for the fans who have been waiting for 7 years to experience the much infamously hyped up winter , the series did not fail to give us the real taste of it, truly , the winter is here .The opening scene, with Arya , killing the Freys, has showed how each of these characters have evolved throughout the seires , from being the sweet summer children in the first episode , to becoming the grizzled up cold adults, the westeros forced them to be.The series has a lot of the main characters taking the center stage , chasing back to their roots , sorta retracing their steps back in many ways. With Arya moving south to finish off her list , with Cersei gathering allies and with Jon preparing for the great war despite having enemies in the south and Finally with Daenerys coming back home , despite conquering a completely different Continent ,the episode has managed to build a grand stage for the people who survived a cold summer, and are preparing themselves to survive an even colder winter.The premiere episode expressed the harsh fact that it's not winter that changed them but it's the summer and fear of welcoming the winter that made them who they are and every single main character has something that reminded how harsh sweet summer was and how the colder winter could be, with Arya worshipping her list , with Sansa constantly under the fear of Cersei, and finally with Cersei keeping her hair short to remind herself of the fact that the atonement will not be the thing westeros will remember her by.All in all , the stage is set, Every single character, have become colder on the inside to face the colder outside world .The stage is setWinter is hereShall we begin ?
s07e01	Outstanding !Danaerys reaches the shores of the home her family held for years. It was an Lord of the Rings sort of epic scene, Dragon hovering over castle of Dragonstone where Dany’s ancestor use to rule. I had goosebumps.Arya extending her Frey killings, it was satisfying. The North remembers Walder boys ! Something was odd,why is this show making Arya a cold killer. Maybe we will find it out later.Love the Hound's development over the series, he stares at the fire for 30 seconds, starts banging out prophecies. He is now officially touched by fire. I think this part of the episode was the best one because at first i didn't have a clue where the group had arrived. But when he found the bodies, it hit me like a truck. The hound is having some serious character development through out the last seasons and i like the way this is going.Bran and Meera make it to the wall and met Edd, Another Stark reunion on the way.Cersei on her way to be the Trump of Westeroes, I am not sure why Jaime is with her. She didn’t even feel anything about Tommen’s death, she was more concerned about how he betrayed her. Then she invited the most psychopath guy the series created to her aid, who advises her that it feels great to kill his own brother.Jon/Sansa and bannermen scene was really important. Jon showed all of them that he is a King and Sansa must not undermine him in front of his bannermen.I will not punish sons and daughters for the crimes of their fathers.Do you know what kind of loyalty that builds with those kids though. He let them live to restore their family honor when everybody else wanted them destroyed. They will be glad that Jon is their King. I'm double glad that Jon and Sansa are communicating their issues.Again, we were back to Arya where she met Ed Sheeren, his cameo really sucked but at least we all know that Lannister are not heartless killer. It shows that morale isn't all that great in Kings Landing and the Lannister army, and that not everyone is out for world domination like Cersei is. I think this will come into play as the battles really get heated.Sam with the poop and soup scene was literally waste of 10 minutes, I just want to say to D&D that we only have 7 episodes. Please don’t waste time, I was eating noodles and I could have vomited. Man I've seen all Kinds of shit on game of thrones from penis mutilation to rape but Sam dealing with the shit pans was the hardest.Last but not the least, one of my favorite character is still alive, Jorah Mormont. The bear that was promised.
s07e01	Less of the Frey, More of the greyThrones has employed cold opens sparingly but brilliantly in the past, and this one is comparatively a letdown, with what is about to transpire becoming plainly obvious the moment we see Walder Frey.Arya’s following scene is a much better one, and not just because she gains insider-access to Ed Sheeran’s latest single. Previously, Arya had denounced the “no-questions-asked” approach of the faceless men and saved herself from devolving into an indiscriminate assassin. Her latest interaction with Lannister men (whose good Samaritan acts would make Cersei’s stomach churn) will make Arya even more empathetic to the need to exercise caution while taking lives.Elsewhere, beneath Sandor Clegane’s tough-as-nails exterior and endless wry quips, an act of decency reveals that he too is weighed down by his past actions of antipathy. His vision in the flames might delay gratification for fans anticipating CleganeBowl however, as it seems like the Hound is headed for a Wall to piss on.Do you still know nothing, Jon Snow?Sansa, who certainly respects Cersei more than her sister Arya does, is being frustrated thanks to King Jon’s aversion to her firebrand ideas. Jon’s decision might prove to be the right one, but he’s little better than past autocrats if he curbs dissidence and simply expects his men (and women) to obey without question.Things are not all downhill for Sansa though. It’s good to see her display tact by keeping Littlefinger close albeit at an arm’s length. The deft manner in which she denied him the last word was delightful.The Winterfell segment was great in general, with the spunky Lady Mormont boldly reiterating her feminist stand, and the risk-reward equation seemingly in favor of punters shipping a Tormund-Brienne dalliance.The ShitadelThe riveting cycle of scenes showing Sam scooping out shit and food alike, were rudely interrupted when Sam breaks into the restricted section of the library and discovers that Dragonstone sits atop a huge untapped reserve of dragonglass.It seems unlikely that Sam will face much corrective action for his sneaking about though, as Professor Slughorn has previously been pretty lax while dealing with youngsters venturing into restricted sections of libraries.Also in Oldtown, the appearance of Jorah Mormont’s animalistic hand suggests that a reliable cure for Greyscale is still elusive.Touchdown!Even though there’s no one present to welcome her back to her ancestral home, Dany couldn’t have timed her return better, with Dragonstone’s real estate value set to skyrocket once knowledge of its constituent minerals becomes public.Having been banished south by Jon last season, I half-expected Melisandre to lie in wait for the arrival of Daenerys in Dragonstone. The Lord of Light’s followers in Essos have already warmed to the idea of Dany being their savior, and it stands to reason that Melisandre will soon once again revise her prediction and exalt Dany as the actual promised one.Cersei ka SwayamvarLike I’d stated a few days back, Jaime is still in love with his arsonist sister. Competing with him for Cersei’s affections now though is the uncouth and randy Euron Greyjoy, who quickly discovers that he’s going to need to offer something more than two hands and an armada if he’s to wed and bed the “most beautiful woman in the seven kingdoms”.All in all, this episode was what we’ve come to expect from season openers in Game of Thrones, with all the kings, queens and pawns slowly moving into positions whence to strike. If the Night King has his way however, the chessboard itself is going to be to flipped upside-down soon.
s07e01	Kind of a slow start, but enjoyable nonetheless. Like most first season episodes, it sets up the stage, with the action picking up in the episodes that follow. Hoping they can keep their momentum though, because there’s only 7 episodes instead of 10!-WINTER HAS COME FOR HOUSE FREY-What a cool way to kick off the season with Arya wearing Walder’s face! When the episode opened with him, I wondered if it was a possible flashback, but then it dawned on me rather quickly. “Walder’s” speech, from praising his family for their deeds, to shaming them, then taunting them, was brilliantly done. It was satisfying to watch those men collapse and die…and even more satisfying for Arya to walk across the grisly scene to Ramin Djawadi’s epic soundtrack.It’s great for Arya to finally be out of that dull House of Black and White (that plot felt like it was going nowhere, even though it was the source of her assassin powers).-SAM’S “TRAINING”-I am rooting for Sam because he is a genuinely kind-hearted character who has managed to survive in this harsh and brutal story. Those die pretty quickly. Although his parts have never been the most exciting ones, they are important to the plot of Game of Thrones nonetheless.Brilliant editing between his repetitive duties as a maester-in-training, made me giggle and want to throw up at the same time. You can almost smell the stench whenever he empties those chamber pots. A lot of people are saying that the dragonglass on Dragonstone has been mentioned already (I had forgotten all about that scene…I kind of zoned out through anything Stannis-related but that’s no excuse). But it could be an error or maybe they assumed people just forgot.Hi, Jorah! He’s already ranting about Daenerys to some stranger he doesn’t know. Hoping the grayscale hasn’t started to affect him mentally.-MARCH OF THE WHITE WALKERS-Chilling, in more ways than one.Hm, that’s a wight-giant over there. Good luck taking THAT down, Jon and Co.-BRAN’S BACK…AND BORING-I dunno…somehow I thought Bran arriving at Castle Black would be a little more eventful? Meera kinda drags him up to the gate, Bran proves his identity by predicting everyone’s potential death by White Walkers…and Edd just lets him in after a pause. The whole scene was kinda ‘meh’. Especially since Jon isn’t there anymore. Bran knows Jon’s true parentage though, so let’s see what he decides to do with this information.-TENSION IS BUILDING AT WINTERFELL-Sansa and Jon begin to disagree and argue. Their worldviews are very different (understandably) because of the experiences they’ve had to endure throughout the show. Sansa’s approach, to take the castles from those who are disloyal and reward them to those who are loyal, is harsher but you can see where she’s coming from. Jon’s approach isn’t bad either, though. Why piss off people you’ve already pissed off in the past? They need all the help they can get, all the allies they can get, and he knows this.When it comes to their actual argument, well, they’re both also wrong despite having workable approaches to ruling. Sansa should not have called out Jon in front of everyone. She is free to voice her opinion but not do so in a way that makes Jon look stupid in front of the entire hall. That being said……Why is Jon STILL scoffing at the fact that Sansa may be right about things? She told Jon not to fall for Ramsay’s trap, boom, he does it anyway. And now he comes back with that ridiculous retort, “What, so I should be listening to you?” Uh, no sh*t? That’s what almost made you lose the Battle of the Bastards in the first place! She told him she knows Ramsay, she’s endured his torment personally…and she has also endured torment from Cersei as well! While I admire Jon’s efforts in being a good ruler, please, Jon, LISTEN TO YOUR SISTER. Right now she is one of your most valuable advisors. I am hoping and praying Jon doesn’t make mistake after mistake and instead becomes a wiser ruler than Dany could ever hope to be.As for Sansa, please don’t let her end up swayed by Littlefinger. She is such a strong, capable young woman who has grown from her experiences. She is understandably hardened from what she went through, and has learned how to read people. This is how she survived so long. So to see her play into Littlefingers hands would be a major disappointment. I am hoping she pretends he has the upper-hand, plays on his weakness, and destroys him in the end. Turns his own strategy against him. That would be a fitting end to that slimy schemer.Side note: Still love the idea of Brienne and Tormund together. Tormund is adorably smitten by her strength and her ability to beat the crap out of others. Brienne has never had a man desire her so she doesn’t quite know what to make of this.Also, Lyanna Mormont’s badassery knows no bounds.-THE HOUND-Sandor Clegane is as entertaining as ever, an anti-hero who is starting to turn things around. He recognizes that little house right away, and knows what’s inside. But he cannot avoid it and has no choice but to face it.Just as he predicted to Arya, the man and his daughter could not survive the coming winter, and the dead man didn’t need silver. That doesn’t make it hurt any less. He freely expresses his doubt in the Lord of Light, because why should one guy get resurrected over and over again for no reason, while innocents like that little girl had to die?After a disturbing vision in the flames, he carefully digs a grave in the freezing cold, laying the poor family to rest. Sandor has a good heart in him, so different from his cruel brother who became the monster he’s always been.- “I’M GOING TO KILL THE QUEEN”Nice little scene featuring Ed Sheeran, thought he made a cute soldier. I had no idea he’d be there, and just thought whoever was singing had a very nice voice. Arya hasn’t lost her humanity yet, and instead of murdering the Lannister soldiers, sits down and eats with them. Too bad Ed Sheeran will most likely meet his end off-screen by dragonfire.-CERSEI AND JAMIE DISCUSS WAR STRATEGY-This part was the one I liked the least.I am disappointed that Jamie’s redemption arc just led him straight back into the palm of Cersei’s hand. Seriously? He went through all that just to be her plaything again? Especially after she just blew up the Sept and murdered a bunch of innocent people…an action all too familiar to him.Euron, please go away, you’re not funny and no one likes you. His ‘swagger’ was embarrassing, and his ‘witty’ comments fell flat to an unimpressed Cersei and Jamie. Now, as soon as he sailed all the way there, he hurries off to grab a ‘gift’ for Cersei to convince her to marry him. Nice job preparing there, Euron. Maybe you should have gotten the gift first and then delivered your cheesy lines after-“SHALL WE BEGIN?”-I can’t stand Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, Mother of Titles, but…I was actually hoping for a bigger scene for her in the first episode instead of a cliffhanger. I want to see how she does on Westerosi soil, and how the other characters react to her. I want to see her struggle and realize that things aren’t so black and white as she thought them to be. Anyway, there were some beautiful shots here, and Dany’s themes still remain some of my favorite ones in the soundtrack (aside from the haunting Stark theme).-CONCLUSION-I am eager to see where episode 2 takes us! There are only six episodes left, so it’s time to get the ball rolling sooner than later!
s07e01	Spoiler AlertSome highlights from the episode 1 Dragonstone:End of Freys!Army and alliances drawn for the big battle!White-walkers on the move!Ed Sheeran doing what he does best, Singing!You would think that after 7 seasons of Game of Thrones we would be fully aware of what to expect from a season premiere. Largely, the premiers to the series have been table setting episodes that dictate the direction the season will most likely be heading. Themes are introduced, pawns are moved around on the chess board, and new characters usually make an appearance. This has been the formula since the inception of the show so there has always been limited expectations for action packed season openers.This season, however, I can't help feeling like there is a bit more disappointment in the overall execution of the episode. Why is that? Well for one this is a shortened season. Even though the episode lengths will be longer than average, the overall run time of the season will be several hours shorter than the previous six seasons. Due to this fact, there is a sense that the writers really need to make of the most of every minute they have on screen. Table setting is all well and good, but payoffs need to come at a more rapid pace this season due to the simple fact of limited screen time in general. By no means to I expect a "Hardhome" or a "Battle of the Bastards" caliber episode on a weekly basis, but events do need to begin to transpire at this point. The pieces are generally set now, and characters for the most part are where they need to be.I sincerely hope next week's episode is a bit more eventful. If it's not then I'm fearing that these writers may have bitten off more than they could chew.
s07e01	An episode of arrivalsA friend of mine said that it was a slow, solid first episode. I agree on the solid part. In terms of story progression, it was not slow in any sense. It was rather an episode of arrivals. Everyone reached to a place or a conclusion and it was kind of warm to see.Arya for one reached her full potential by vanquishing an entire house Frey. Her meeting the soldiers was an interesting scene. Maybe the boy who offered her wine would be the one to be her love interest.The army in the north arrived on a conclusion and the entire scene established Jon snow as a powerful and firm ruler. It was again, extremely important since last time the crows killed him for not liking his decisions. Also the little tussle between Sansa and snow was good and so was her wariness with little finger.Cercei and the Lannisters arrived to a certain point of desperation and just when you thought she was out of ideas, there arrived one Mr. Greyjoy with his thousand ships and a proposal.The hound arrived to a belief in the lord of lights. He could finally see what he had denied for long. Also if I am not mistaken, the dead father and daughter were the same who had fed him and Arya once. They died of starvation. Ironic, isn't it?At the citadel, finally Sam reached to arrived to the knowledge which is of utmost importance. Also, whose hand was it?Last but not the least, the dragon queen has arrived at dragonstone. The look in her eyes was of invincibility, of a knowledge that she deserves the throne and she would aquire it anyway.Fun episode altogether.
s07e01	Opening scene was pretty good, and David Bradley plays Arya-as-Walder perfectly, especially that whole “leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe” thingOldtown looks amazing in the opening credits though I’m confused why they kept the Baratheon stag in King’s LandingWhite Walker army is shown, and they have giants. Well crap.Bran Stark proves his worth as the three-eyed raven by diving deep down to Lord Commander Dolorous Edd’s deepest secrets. Way to go Bran.Lyanna Mormont looking badass gets a thumbs-up from me. I feel kinda sorry for Lord Glover though; owned twice by a 10-year old girl.Jon and Sansa have interesting chemistry, which is great character development especially for Sansa. However, even though they disagreed with what to do with the Karstarks and Umbers (sidenote: welcome Alys Karstark to the show!), they’re still allied…for now.Littlefinger doing what Littlefinger always does.Also it may be a good use of foreshadowing for Jon and Sansa’s relationship to fall apart after they call each other like Joffrey and Cersei.Speaking of Cersei she has a map now. Maps are cool.Dear writers: how did Euron get so much ships when it is shown there isn’t that much trees in the Iron Islands. Seriously?Also, Euron’s a bit less lame but still not as cool as book Euron. Sorry.I just love Jaime’s reaction to all this.Instead of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the Citadel now looks like the Hogwarts School of Puking and Cleaning Shit. I think that those shots were a bit too much, but we can see how miserable Sam’s life is. RIP.I just love the continuing relationship between Tormund and Brienne! (sidenote: RIP Podrick)We get some injection of morals into Arya with the addition of Ed Sheeran and the Lannister soldiers. Shows that not all bad guys are bad, in just about the perfect way possible. Way to go.Sandor Clegane apparently switched morals with Arya Stark now and is merciful. The scene shows it perfectly when he buries the farmer and his daughter which he killed in Season 4.Also, Sandor can see through the flames now. Goody.Sam apparently has amnesia and forgot dragonglass was in Dragonstone. Sure, I guess.Also, Horace Slughorn as Archmaester Marwyn! Still not into that whole White Walker thing though, with pretty flawed logic.After Marwyn leaves, Jorah Mormont conveniently chooses this time to jumpscare Sam. Yeesh, give him a break! Jorah asks for what happened to Dany, and we cut to……Dany, finally reaching Dragonstone. This is the perfect ending for this episode, as it sets the tone for the episodes to come.In summary, this episode was pretty good. I’d rank it in my top 20. The Sam scenes I feel was a bit too much, and Euron could be less joking and more intimidating. Otherwise, it was brilliant.
s07e01	It was okay. I’ll give it a generous 6/10 stars. 10 would be first-season-level, awe-inspiring, jaw-dropping; 1/10 is…Season 5? The “bad pussy” episode that got D&D a goddamn Emmy. Cinematically gorgeous, good acting, great music, masterful editing. But I found myself getting almost bored in the middle of the episode; after the cold-open, I had gotten so hype, and I knew the Dragonstone-landing scene was going to come up eventually, so it felt like I was waiting between those two climactic bookends.I’ll break down my thoughts with regards to each area/character/storyline:The cold open was great. Still conflicted over the whole Arya/Lady Stoneheart dealio, given that Arya is a traumatized child who uses her kill-list as a method of coping with her untreated PTSD, and her arc in the books is about mercy (literally there, in her name), so becoming Mother Merciless seems very backwards. But man, was it vindicating to have the Freys killed in one fell swoop. (Arya, did you remember to feed/water your uncle and let him out for a walk? Or is he still in the Frey dungeons? Seems like a big oversight.)I liked the Ed Sheeran scene for what it represents thematically. I heard his voice and was like…wait…is that…? The parallels with her scene with the Freymen who mock Catelyn’s death and these Lannister men are nice. You can tell Arya is thinking about Ned when that soldier talks about his dad all alone on the boat, and this will be the start to the whole “a girl is going home” deal that she was supposed to be working on in the interim between seasons. Guess she forgot that and is going down to King’s Landing, but she’ll be going North soon enough. She’s never getting to King’s Landing. (Side note: where the hell are they supposed to be? There’s not as much snow as we see with the Brotherhood Without Banners scene, yet this group is presumably closer to the Twins, the castle at the very north of the Riverlands. And yet Sandor and Beric and the merry men are knee-deep in frozen soil and snow, and they’re by the house with the father and daughter close to the border between the Vale and the Riverlands. Presumably they’re relatively close to Saltpans, given where Arya heads later. But they look like they’re north of Moat Cailin.)Speaking of, the scenes with Sandor and Beric and Thoros? Great. Nice nod to the Gravedigger scenes. Not sure how I feel about Sandor having “true fire visions” but I like where this is headed, writing-wise. Wherever it is now, and wherever it is headed in the future. I like that they show the consequences of wars and winter on the smallfolk. I was worried that would be ignored.Oldtown credit reveal is great, but the Oldtown sequence was kind of disappointing to me. It took too long, and while the editing is masterful, it felt like something that should have been left on the cutting room floor. The reveal that Dragonstone has obsidian is a) redundant and b) a shameless excuse to get Jon to Dany. They recast Lil’ Sam, still cute. Gilly reading and helping Sam with the books was a nice scene. I saw Littlefinger’s Valyrian dagger from way back in Season 1 there. Then there’s Jorah. How he got into Oldtown, I don’t know, given the Hightowers’ justifiable response to plague entering the city.I like how Edd just accepts that these two teenagers are who they say they are based on things Edd already knows. How about Bran says, “My brother is Jon Snow, the former Lord Commander, whose direwolf Ghost is silent and white and deadly. You have a Brother who let me in through the gate, which in the books is the Nightfort, and his name is Samwell. I know there’s Bad Shit Beyond-the-Wall, and Jon needs to know more about what’s coming for him. I think my sister Sansa is also in Winterfell; also I’m a druid prince boy so please let me in as my friend Meera Reed, daughter of Howland ‘Lord Not Appearing in this Show’ Reed is very cold and tired from dragging me about a mile from the Haunted Forest to the Wall.” Lord Commanding looks good on the new Lord Commander. Hope he doesn’t die when the Wall falls. He probably will.Jon/Sansa in Winterfell, co-ruling. Should they have worked out what they were going to say with regards to the Karhold and Last Hearth before they went before the lords and ladies? Yes. I err on the side of caution and reward, so I was with Sansa, until they marched out little Ned Umber and cute Alys Karstark. If they hadn’t been children, I don’t think anyone would be as sympathetic, and Jon’s argument would seem much more gullible. I would rather see Alys and Ned warded at Winterfell, with commanders holding the keeps during the War. After Dawn rises, they can be married off to loyalists and returned to their ancestral homes. A nice compromise, one that keeps the children safe and everyone happy, and won’t keep peace for a generation (like Jon’s will, because what’s stopping Alys and Ned’s kids from remembering the blood spilled feuding with the Starks? Sansa harms this generation to keep peace for a long time, like the Manderlys in the books (“The wolves took us in and nourished us and protected us against our enemies…In return we swore that we should always be their men. Stark men!”)And I love little Lyanna Mormont with all my heart, and I love that there appear to be at least four would-be parents drafting adoption papers for her (Davos, Brienne, Sansa and Jon are going to have to duke it out over custody rights). I’m not a huge fan of the “knitting” line—I understand it, but I have an issue with domestic femininity being placed below male-coded tasks consistently throughout this show—as though warriors won’t need warm knit socks and scarves. Lyanna Mormont doesn’t have to knit, nor Sansa nor Arya nor Lord Glover’s granddaughter, nor should the men be automatically drafted as warriors. Wars are not won on the backs of men alone. The American Revolution would have been a lost cause before it began if not for the women who melted silver and lead and steel into balls for muskets, and sewed flags and uniforms for the men. There’s a lot of controversy, and I think I err on the side that doesn’t pit women against women or female-tasked as lesser than male-tasks. I understand why she says what she does, but knitting is so gender-coded of a task in Westeros that it implies that any woman who does sit by the fire and knit for the warriors is contributing less than those who choose to take up a different kind of needle. But that’s not an in-episode thing I’ve thought of, it’s something that’s been bothering me for the week since I watched. Schools or prisons, socks or swords, and all that.Euron is very silly. He was very silly last season and very silly this season. I’m already tired of him. (I want warlock pirate Eldritch abomination Euron Greyjoy, not a fedora-wearing Jack Sparrow.) His “crow’s eye” emblem on his sail looks…not very eye-like, to say the least.Cersei and Jaime. Sad to see Jaime is still more-or-less on Cersei’s side but the combined gut-punch of Tommen’s death (wtf Cersei, his “betrayal”? Do you mean outlawing trial by combat? Suicide isn’t a betrayal.) and Euron’s jabs, Jaime’s resolve is wavering. I like that. I demand more.The nice moment of “let Dany feel cool and have her moment” between Missandei and Grey Worm was great. Pulling down the Baratheon banner feels like karmic justice for what D&D did to Stannis Baratheon’s storyline. Rest in peace, Stannis the Mannis, knowing your book counterpart is either gonna die after successfully taking Winterfell or kill a fucking shit-ton of Boltons, Freys and traitorous Umbers. And it’s gonna be fucking sweet as hell.Also, this quote gives it so much more meaning.Dany had never looked upon the Usurper’s face, yet seldom a day had passed when she had not thought of him. His great shadow had lain across her since the hour of her birth, when she came forth amidst blood and storm into a world where she no longer had a place.Your mama would be so proud of you. Your dad and brothers were Not Great though. You and Rhaella should have survived and had a cool but complicated mother-daughter relationship. Dragonstone looks way cooler than it did before . You’d think King Stannis would have sat in the throne room once or twice, but nope. Also, you’d think King’s Landing already had a giant map of Westeros somewhere.No Sands in this episode, so I give it an extra point. (I like Indira Varma and I think it’s a waste and a shame what they’ve done to her character and the Dornish plotline altogether.) No Olenna. No Theon. No Yarasha. Just hanging out on the boat, I guess. At least the dragons are happy to be home!Anyway, a lot of exposition, relatively little pay-off, and a lot of scenes felt overly long or unnecessary, but the show is, as ever, technically brilliant in terms of direction/cinematography/editing/costuming/acting. Writing and pacing were very off. We have Chekov’s guns to fire, D&D! We only have 12 episodes left! Let’s go, come on!
s07e01	It was pretty good. Things are getting warmed up so anyone expecting a full blown war from the very first episode is bound to be disappointed. But the episode ensured to take all the concerned parties in account and what are they up to.Let’s start with three of the best lines of the episode:Euron making japes on Jaime’s expense: And with two good hands, you (Cersei) should try it(Cersei - you murdered your own brother); Euron - You should try it, feels wonderful(LF - What do you want?); Sansa - At this moment, peace and quiteNow with the recap and review:White Walkers + Wall - The army of dead is marching and they have 3 Giants with them as well. Meera and Bran are at the Wall and are escorted in by Edd who believes Bran after being told about the others. Short scenes, I believe they will start getting more and more time as the plot of Iron Throne is resolvedArya - House Frey’s short cameo ended in the first few minutes, thanks to Arya. Chilling speech that ends with The North Remembers. She is on a mission and is now heading towards King’s Landing to kill Cersei. Her meeting with some Lannister soldiers on the way was maybe to soften her rapidly progressing killer instincts. Ed Sheeren made a cameo. Edmure/Tullys were not mentioned, so fate of Riverrun is left for next episodes.Jon and Sansa - Sansa had the same opinion as I have maintained in my answers after season 6. Grant the castles of Karstark and Umber to loyal families. Jon went with a different, and more mature, approach and ensured that the family homes are not taken away from children Ned Umber and Alys Karstark. While in this scene, he was firm, in the next he was plain rude. Sansa was trying to have a dialogue with him over their different opinions and he keeps repeating “you can’t undermine me”. Agreed but give a solution Jon, start communicating with people on your side. Maybe it is to heighten the tension between him and Sansa (LF later uses it to chip at Sansa in a brief scene). Their discussion about Cersei was also an example of their different priorities. Jon is fully focused on Others while Sansa thinks Cersei is the prime threat.Cersei + Jaime + Euron - Impressive opening with map of 7 kingdoms and Jaime and Cersei discussing on the coming wars. News of Frey slaughter has reached them and so is the update on their enemies (Highgarden, North, Dorne, Dany). Where are their allies? asks Jamie and enters Euron with his Iron fleet. Euron makes a long monologue in throne room and after Cersei refuses his marriage proposal (why?? who else will come to her aid??), promises to come back with a precious gift (Dragonbinder?)Sam with cameo from Jorah - Citadel is grilling Sam so much that he has lost weight there, not at the Wall, but at Citadel. Let that sink in. He also finally takes matters in his own hand, when no one seems ready to help him learn about long night, and learns that there is a MOUNTAIN of DRAGONGLASS beneath the grounds of Dragonstone. He promptly sends a letter to Jon which will act as an initial step for Jon and Dany’s meeting (as evident from the earlier released set pics). In the last seconds, he is inquired about Dragon queen by Jorah (who is locked in a cell and has his entire arm covered in greyscale).Hound + BwB - A repentant Hound has to face two horrors.Take shelter in the house where he and Arya earlier stayed, which he robbed and left the father and daughter to die. He later dug their graves (call out to gravedigger, perhaps).To gaze in the fire to learn the threat of White Walkers. It seems that Lord of Light has won himself another loyal soldier.Dany + Tyrion + Varys + Grey Worm + Missandei + Dany’s Dragons - An emotional Dany returns to her birth place and ancestral seat of her house. In a beautifully shot sequence, she lands and touches the sand of her home, walks in her castle, pass the throne to the war room and speaks the words to set the tone of the remaining season - Shall we begin?. Love her or hate her, she gets some great moments for herself in the show.Image source - Inverse
s07e01	Spoiler alert. Trying to keep the spoilers to a minimum.It was..okay for me. Good start. But I expected Season 7 to hit the ground running because it's not ten episodes anymore!I really wish that Dany's “Shall we begin?” scene had been the end of Season 6. I wanted her to actually begin something in this season.Arya's mass murder was a good start.Jon and Sansa's back and forth is going to be interesting. And so is Bran coming to the Wall.Sansa's comeback to Littlefinger was epic :DJorah seems to have travelled faster than Dany on her ships. I didn't expect him to make an appearance.Now the Hound's scene. That was very nice. His human side is really refreshing to see. Plus, those scenes also touch the Gravedigger line of story from the books (If only slightly).All in all, this episode stood out in those little moments: witty comments and well-executed expected scenes (Oh, and Ed Sheeran <3). I hope it picks up the pace quickly.Come on, D&D, you don't have ten episodes anymore :(
s07e01	I loved it.(Spoilers alert, obv)True, as most GoT season premiers go, this didn’t have a lot of “events”. But it did have it’s cinematic highlights:The Samwell Tarly “latrine” montage in Oldtown: Absolutely marvellous work by the editing team.The smart use of “maps”:In one of the scenes, Cersei is seen getting a painting of the Westeros done on the floor, and immediately after, she is seen walking around the map as she converses with Jamie.Later, we see Daenerys around the map, in Stannis’ “war room”, where we see her reaching out with hands to touch it.If you think about it, there is another set of meaning to be derived from the scene. Right now, Cersei and Daenerys are the two true contestants for ruling the seven kingdoms. (Jon is, quite correctly, fixated on defeating the bigger threat to humanity). But both of them have different styles of ruling. While one tries to be a true leader, rejecting inhumane atrocities and reaching out to commoners as her subjects, the other believes in trampling over her subjects and ruling through power.Setting up events around the wall and upcoming war: In couple of scenes, first, Jon dispatching the wildlings to Eastwatch by the sea, and then the vision of the Hound, the viewers are prepped for the upcoming war and the horrors to come. I wouldn’t be surprised if we lose some of our beloved characters in that war.With the additional events like Arya’s actions and character development, and the development around the relationship between Jamie and Cersei, the premier does what it was supposed to do - prep the viewers for all that’s about to come.The only thing which is little alarming, is that this season would only have 6 episodes, unlike the previous seasons. Hence we should anticipate an increased pace. The last seasons had time for character and story development. This season, not so much.
s07e01	Well everyone has gave a wonderful review and covered almost everything, so I will point out some new details I found interesting.1.The opening credits now includes The Citadel at oldtown.2. We all are aware still I will point out, Pop Singer Ed Sheeran(Shape of you) had a brief cameo in the episode.The song he is singing is from the 3rd book : “A Storm of Swords”.Here :3.Now have a look at The Valyrian Steel dagger in Sam’s bookThis is kind of familiar sword which was used by Assassin to kill Bran in 1st season, here:4. Also the text mentions that Dragonglass being used as “Cure”Probably that will cure Ser Jorah!5. The Night King is bringing the “Storm” with him, as Jon Snow said in season 6 episode 10 : “The Winds of Winter”Winter is here!
s07e01	The opening scene was cold and brutal. Arya as Walder Frey, killing all the Frey men. It was one of the best scenes in the entire episode.White Walkers heading towards the Wall has got everyone curious about what will happen next and has set the bar high for coming episodes.Scenes from Winterfell were brilliant as well. Jon Snow made some good decisions.Conversation between Cersei and Jamie was good. Euron mocking Jamie was fun to watch.The montage of Sam in Citadel was uncalled for, and boring. Although, it was nice to see Jorah there, asking for Daenerys and Sam discovering that Dragonstone has a lot of dragonglass there.Bran arrives south of the wall with Meera.The Ed Sheeran scene was interesting but I don’t see it serving any purpose in the future.Beric, Thoros and Hound had good conversation but the scenes were too elaborate and unnecessary. Probably, it has something to do in the future.Daenerys landed in Dragonstone with her fleet, dragons and Tyrion! That scene was exceptional but there were no dialogues involved. We’ll see what the future holds.Sorry for the spoilers!!! I wouldn’t say this was a review, but it gives my take on each scene in the episode.
s07e01	it was awsome but hurried up the storyline with a lot happening within a short period of timelets discuss thing i found intresting1)Arya: reply to lord frey’s wife: tell them winter came for the frey’s.*Walks out without giving a fuck*hanging out with lannister soldiers.(Ed cameo was’nt worth it).She while talking to them was knowing about their sorrows and griefs also checking out their weapon positions so we know she is gonna kill the fuck out of them. also this season there is a possibility to show us the dragon pits in kingslanding about which one of the soldiers talked about2)Jon and Sansa’s lil arguement : that grin on little finger’s face confirmed there is going to be a bigger fight in context to power dividing between both of them. Sansa wants the south but jon focus’s on the north.We know both are correct from their point of view but if both attacks are simultaneous, they are fucked so need of discussions3)KingsLanding senario : Its very easily visible how much disgust and fear of cercei is filled within Jamie. he is trying to keep his distance observing her moves and not speaking much. Bam comes Euron! Teases him by saying he has 2 good hands(stating jamie and cercei incest) and the look on jamies’s face was mind blowing.the gift Euron talks about is either daneryes’s head or the dragon bender(a horn in the books which allows the user to tame a dragon species. allegedly even dragon bloodline)4)Samwell tarly book Reading session: As he turns the page a picture is seen of the knife used in the first season to attack bran while he was in coma after the fall. the same knife that was planted by littlefinger. sam also says they used dragon glass to decorate steel. there must be a spolier for recipe of valarian steel making5)the Night’s king army approaching through the winter storm and hound: It seems the spoiler for what is gonna be known to us ahead was given in the start. suggesting the night’s king is creating the winter storm to hide him and his wight army within it. he has an enlarged army marching towards the weakest point of the magic of the wall. the east fort which was seen in season 4 visited by jon. its making me nervous as that the magic will not work further as bran stark has crossed the wall towards the south.6)daenaryes Stormborn : Returning to her place of birth Dragonstone. She was born on a stormy night hence the title stormborn which is also the title of season 7 episode 2. while she was being born the grey joy’s had attacked the ships docked at dragonstone hinting to it happening again which i mentioned as euron’s gift by destroying the mode of her transport he will be destroming her chances of getting off the island with her army hence getting her head to cercei.7)breif Encounter of Jorah Mormont(nothing to say here)8)The joke at citadel: the food(soup) and the laterine pot seem very simmilar and also as time went by it became exact same as to hinting they have been eating shit.
s07e01	It was an exposition episode. It set up the motives for the characters for the rest of season well:Arya’s going to kill everyone.The undead army is heading south to kill everyone.Meera and Bran are heading south to help Jon.Jon is trying his hardest to get everyone on the same page and to be earnest about it, dang it!Tormund and the Free Folk go to the Wall.Sansa is asserting herself, but she’s still wearing a leash necklace. Jon can't quit the patriarchy and take advice from her without making it sound like he’s accusing her of wanting to order him around. Is she doing this to make Littlefinger think he has an in?Cersei’s trying to act like her father (and I like what they said after the episode, that if she stopped and reflected on what’s happened, she would emotionally crash).Jaime is still her right hand man (I didn’t realize that would be a pun until after I typed it) and he’s going after the Tyrells.Euron is …slightly unhinged, and claims he wants to marry Cersei and is going to come back with something “priceless” (if the leaked photos are true, I don’t expect Cersei to be impressed). Jaime’s criticism of Euron was also a good show of his devotion to family and increasing openness of his sense of basic decency.Sam is going to find a way to help Jon, even if he has to steal books to do it. The maesters really are removed from it all. People dying at the moment? It’ll pass. And no Marwyn, you are *not* the institutionalized collective memory of Westeros. That would be the weirwood web. Also, the people in the cells, like Jorah, must have a miserable existence.And Dany’s going to war. Hello, Dragonstone. I know after the episode D&D said they wanted everyone to give Dany a moment, but I really needed Tyrion to quip “Could use a little cleaning,” before she said her line.
s07e01	Walking In a Winter WonderlandWalder Frey (obviously Arya) is hosting a happy meal where lovebirds go to wed and get dead. She talks to the Freys about the Red Wedding and how they made the mistake of not killing ALL the Starks, as she poisons their cups (but spare the lives of the women, awesomely). When they die she reveals her face. She looks a bit grown up, and more beautiful than ever. She tells the girl what to say to anyone who asks what happened here, and walks out of the hall, with a victorious smile.We see the army of the dead in the cold. It's unclear where they are though. There are three giants-turned-wights! Bring on Spiderwights!Bran and Meera arrive at the Wall's gate. Grenn and others from the Night's Watch go out to greet them and ask if they are Wildlings. Meera tells them who they are but Grenn is suspicious and wants confirmation. Bran talks about the White Walkers, the Fist of the First Men, Hardhome and other things Grenn witnessed. I thought he'd talk more about Jon, but nope. Grenn invites them in, and the men carry Bran- finally Meera can rest, phew..!At Winterfell's Great Hall, Jon controversially says everyone from 10 to 60 years old has to fight, boys and girls- and Lyanna Mormont supports him. The northerners think they should burn the Karstarks and Umber's castles down, Sansa says they need them and give it to someone else, but Jon says he will not punish children for their fathers' sins and or rob homes from houses that had allegiance to house Stark for years. Sansa loudly and publicly disagrees in front of everyone. Jon is visibly upset but carries on, and Ned Umber and Alys Karstark pledge allegiance.Later, Jon and Sansa talk privately and he scolds her for undermining him. She tells him he's a good ruler but she's afraid he'll repeat their father and brother's mistakes. A raven arrives from King's Landing: Cersei wants Jon to bend the knee or else he'll suffer the fate of traitors. Sansa tells Jon once Cersei sees you as an enemy she'll stop at nothing to destroy you; Jon suggests Sansa admires her, and she says she's learned a lot from her.Speaking of the bitch, Cersei and Jaime are in a patio of the Red Keep, where painters are painting a map of Westeros. Jaime brings up Tommen and the fact they didn't speak about him, Cersei says he betrayed them, and though she loved him and all their family, they're dead anyway, but she and him are alive- "the only Lannisters that count". Cersei talks about their foes: enemies to the West (Daenerys, Tyrion coming from Essos), enemies to the East (Olenna "the old cunt" in Highgarden), Enemies to the South ("Ellaria and her band of bitches!"), and enemies to the North (Jon, Sansa, etc). She is oblivious to another enemy coming after her personally- Arya. Jaime says they're in danger and without allies. Cue for Euron Greyjoy's badass-looking fleet to swoop in and save the day at the shores of King's Landing.Euron comes to the Throne Room, with a new haircut. Euron admires Jaime for his battle skills during the failed Greyjoy Rebellion, Jaime says "the people I was cutting down were your own people!" and Euron just says "it was getting crowded anyway". He suggests his support if Cersei will marry him, and even says he has a thousand ships and "two perfectly good hands"- which pisses Jaime off and otherwise is hilarious. Cersei turns him down and says she doesn't trust him, he killed his own brother, to which he replies "you should try it, feels wonderful" with Jaime right there. Euron says he'll buy Cersei's trust with a priceless gift, and he'll only come back to King's Landing with it to change her mind. So far his vicious and cocky remarks were entertaining, but will Euron fulfill his promise to be the next big villain?We go back to Arya, travelling on a horse, when she hears a pleasant man's voice which sounds very familiar for some reason… oh my God it's Ed Sheeran. I heard he'd appear but totally forgot about that. Arya sits down with Ed Sheeran's gang of nice Lannister soldiers. It appears that Arya contemplates killing them, but after small talk about family gets attached. They ask her where she's headed, she says King's Landing (damn it Arya! Go home already!), they ask what for, she says: "I'm going to kill the queen". They all burst laughing hysterically and she joins their laughter and smiles… You have no idea, guys..!Arya still isn't a totally hateful senseless serial killer like Lady Stoneheart- as evident by her selectively sparing the lives of all the Frey women and by choosing not to kill the soldiers. But, seeing she went on a Frey killing spree and is next headed to King's Landing, her list seems the only home she's going to. Though she shows signs of humanity, her direction still worries me: she has a chance to come home to Winterfell and reunite with Jon and Sansa, soon Bran too most likely, but she doesn't take it (then again maybe she just doesn't know they're there). She might miss the final chance to have a reunion and family as they or she could die before it happens.We get a short scene of Littlefinger's blatant attempt to turn Sansa against Jon. She just doesn’t give a singular fuck what he says. When Brienne shows up Sansa gets rid of him and he walks away defeated. Sansa is wide awake, disillusioned, and unafraid to speak her mind: she doesn’t always agree with Jon but that has nothing to do with Littlefinger; she just looks at the game differently and doesn't want Jon to be as gullible or rash as Ned, Catelyn and Robb were. I'm proud of how she's handling Petyr.The Hound, Thoros of Myr, Beric Dondarrion and the Brotherhood without Banners travel through the snow. They get to a house that's strangely familiar: where a man and his daughter gave the Hound and Arya food and shelter, and the Hound ended up stealing from them thinking they'll not survive the winter anyway.. and sure enough he was right, but he feels bad. They enter the house and find the corpses. The Hound ponders out loud with Beric about why of all people he has been resurrected repeatedly when this innocent little girl just died (well hello, to give the Kiss of Life for somebody important, surely!). Thoros makes Sandor look into the flames, and in them he sees "Ice. A wall of ice. The wall. Where the castle meets the sea. There's a mountain, looks like an arrowhead. The dead are marching past. Thousands of them". Though it doesn't necessarily make the Hound a believer, or help with his fear of fire (yet)- it does give him a purpose. The Hound buries the man and girl and Thoros helps him.In Oldtown, Sam performs literally shitty duties involving stinky old men's crap (oh my God, they actually eat from the dishes they shit in at the Citadel?!) in a fun, untypical montage where Sam is close to vomit several times- a purely comic and refreshing moment. They sure have strange customs, these Maesters. I mean, they're supposed to be wise, don’t they know you don’t shit where you eat?! I love how last season OIdtown was set-up as this magical place Sam's going to enjoy and finally find purpose and an episode later it's revealed in all its rainbows of shit. There's a restricted area in the library that conveniently has all the books Sam needs, and I'm getting Harry Potter feels.Sam accompanies an old Archmaester (not directly named in the episode but officially called Ebrose), performed by Jim Broadbent, as they weigh organs from an open body. Sam asks for permission to go to the restricted area in the library and says he's seen the army of the dead and he needs information to help defeat them. Ebrose says the Wall and Westeros survived Robert's Rebellion, Aegon's Conquest before that, and the Long Night before that, so they'll survive again. Naturally Sam just steals the key to the restricted area from a sleeping Maester and takes whatever books he may need.Sam and Gilly find something useful at last: Dragonstone has a shitload of dragonglass- a whole mountain of it. He must tell Jon. As Sam walks a corridor an ugly disgusting hand reaches out to him through a tiny window in a cell, and a voice asks if the queen of dragons has arrived at Westeros yet, and Sam says he doesn't know… Yes, it's Jorah!And speaking of Dragonstone and Dany, the last scenes follow Dany, Tyrion and co. as they finally get to Westeros. Dany's first stop is Dragonstone, her birthplace and ancestral home. At the beach, Dany bends over to touch the sand- its real, this is it, I finally made it, and I'm home. She and the Fellowship of the Queen make their way into the castle. Dragonstone looks majestic and marvelous, especially the twisted mountain path to the castle gates. After she passes the Throne Room, she sees the iconic Westeros-shaped table, touches it, and breaks the fourth wall asking: "Shall we begin?". Oh, hell yeah. What a brilliant call to have no character say a word until the last seconds.The episode does a great job of positioning (almost) all our beloved (and hated) characters and easing them into place in their character arcs, introducing new characters, bringing old characters together, setting the stage for future plotlines. No Theon, Yara, Ellaria + Sand Snakes (totally fine with it), Olenna, Melisandre, Gendry, Hot Pie, Ghost or Nymeria yet. One thing I really loved about the episode was its humor: Sam's stinky adventures in the Citadel, Euron's vicious but otherwise amusing statements, the Hound's sarcasm and irony, the way people laugh at Arya unaware how freaking dead serious she is. For a show this dark and depressing, this is a fresh way to get back in business, and we can scarcely hope for funnier or lighter moments.Great Quotes:-"The Wall has stood through it all, and every winter that ever came has ended" (Ebrose the Archmaester)-"No need to seize the last word, lord Baelish. I'll assume it was something clever" (Sansa Stark. And hey Littlefinger, apply water to the burned area!)-"When people ask you what happened here… Tell them the North remembers. Tell them winter came for house Frey" (Arya Stark)-"So there's no punishment for treason, and no reward for loyalty?" (Sansa Stark)-"It's my fucking luck I end up with a bunch of fire worshippers!" (Oh, Houndy)Questions:1) Is Wun-Wun one of the giants who went full-on Walking Dead? (He died at Winterfell, and the Walkers haven't crossed the wall yet…)2) Will Ned Umber, Alys Karstark and Marwin the Maester play a significant role in the events to come?3) What does Euron plan to give Cersei as a gift? Is it one of her enemies' head (Tyrion, Dany, Sansa, Ellaria, Olenna, etc.)? Is it Dragonbinder, the legendary horn that controls dragons in the books, which would help Cersei defeat Dany?4) Is Marwin the Maester really Jaquen H'ghar in disguise?5) We got a glimpse of Jorah's hand, but didn't see his face or the rest of his body properly. Plus he is locked in quarantine, it appears. Beside the hand, how far has the Greyscale spread?6) Speaking of Jorah, did he just touch Sam and OH NO IS SAM INFECTED NOW?! :O7) Though Melisandre is nowhere to be seen, we know she is coming back to Dragonstone; will she be pissed to see Dany's redecoration- and how fast will she proclaim her a Messiah?8) Bran is officially in Castle Black. Some have speculated the Mark of the Beast (the mark the Night King gave Bran) will break the Wall's protective spells, once he passes. Is the wall vulnerable now?9) Will we ever see visions in the flames as characters see them, or will it deliberately be left for our imagination and judgment to determine if it's true?10) Regarding the dragonglass in Dragonstone… Shouldn't Davos and Melisandre already know about that? They practically lived there, didn't they? Sam knew and forgot, so it is one hell of a plothole.And here is the edited version, first ever article I published! In the site TellTales:Game of Thrones ‘Dragonstone’ – A Visual Recap
s07e01	I think it was just great.The first scene with the Arya killing all the Freys shows how, good she has become as a assassin now, and I guess main part of her revenge is complete.The scene with Jon and Sansa was also good, showing that Jon is really becoming a good leader, making decisions that he thinks are good but Sansa is also right in saying that Jon should be careful, because both Ned and Robb also thought they made good decisions and we know what happened.This alliance between Cersei and Euron, which Jaime doesn’t like is gonna be interesting to watch. What’s the gift gonna be??The Hound scene, was sad in a way but i guess it is trying to make Hound a bit of a sympathetic character.Sam, and his scene in Oldtown was good as well, he’s certainly having trouble convincing main people there to take threat of white walkers seriously and his finding of Dragonglass in Dragonstone I guess sets the stage for meeting between Dany and Jon, which is gonna be great.Arya and her scene with Lannister soldiers, also tried to show nuance about wars, that not all soldiers are bad people, but just doing their job, well written.Lastly, Daenarys finally in Dragonstone, i thought it did deserved more time, but not bad.So, a very good premiere. Only 7 episodes this season and things definitely will be moving fast.
s07e01	The beginning could not have been any better. Arya Stark with 50+ kills and a warning for the Freys. Top stuff!It kind of went downhill from there-Sam’s shitty life.Cersei’s plans were lukewarm. I expected Euron’s visit to be more dramatic.The Hound whining and complaining.Jon Snow finally killed the boy, I suppose. He is acting like a true king. Lyanna Mormont still has rhe fiercest heart in all of the North.Baelish needs to keep it in his pants. He is kind of pointless now. Even with his Army.Dany Targaeryan’s scenes were done very well. The music was outstanding. Overall, a positive start but didn’t have any of the epic stuff.Arya is still a badass. Watch and learn, fellas!Rating - 7.5/10– Vivek Pavani
s07e01	*SPOILER ALERT**********SPOILER YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED***********It's nice to see the story progress but I think it's safe to say that this can be classified as a filler episode. At this point it's pretty obvious that Cersei is fucking crazy and Jamie is at o with her over Tyrion even though he won't state it outright. Arya Stark with Walder’s face was pretty obvious since he was killed by her in Season 6. It was pretty epic when she killed all those soldiers/Freys who massacred her family at the Red Wedding. The entire speech as well Arya gave. Samwell Tarly discovering the mountain of dragonglass beneath dragon stone really is amazing reall, and that is saying a lot for a series that is basically a pop culture phenomenon. It's great to see the Hound’s and Arya’s arc development without bogging the story down. I still am not a fan of Sansa but she is becoming headstrong. I like how everything is coming together with poor Ser Jorah’s arc intertwining with Samwell’s. I feel sorry for him since his greyscale is getting worse but I can see his devotion to Daene through his suffering. The transition from Jorah to Daenerys in the scene is amazing. I'm glad to see that there is more progress now that Dany is in dragonstone but I just hope that it keeps progressing unlike in previous seasons. Since this is episode 1 I will give her the benefit of the doubt.
s07e01	Shall we begin?Spoilers ahead if you haven’t watched the episode yet.Ah, Winter is finally here. After an unusually long period of waiting and prevaricating, the world’s biggest TV show today, Game of Thrones finally graced us with its penultimate season. Dragons and direwolves, heroes and villains, violence and gratuitous nudity, everything we love about the show is back.Well, not quite.Here are some of my takeaways from the Season 7 premiere ‘Dragonstone’.The North RemembersOh yes, it does. I’ll admit I wasn’t surprised by how the scene would turn out to be once we see Walder Frey cackling over his goblet of wine. But, that didn’t in the slightest mean that I didn’t enjoy the Frey clan and many of its soldiers choking over their own wine, poisoned by a vengeful wolf. Fan service or not, that really was one satisfactory scene to watch. Did it have to open the show though? Maybe, just maybe not.Also, Arya is going to King’s Landing to kill the Queen. Should go well for both of them.Read more at Game Of Thrones Season 7 Premieres In A Slow-Burning 'Dragonstone:' ED Review
s07e01	I am a little disappointed that it wasn't more dynamic. The producers mentioned that since the season only has 7 episodes they would be fast paced and cover more ground. I didn't see that. The highlight was seeing Arya use her skills as a student of Jaquen H’gar to execute her plans of retribution. I was hoping that Sansa had learned what not to do by observing the duplicity of Littlefinger. But I think the wedge that began between Jon and Sansa will get worse now that she undermined Jon at the meeting. I know Vayrs is called the spider, but Little finger is appearing more spiderlike. He sits and watches people spinning their webs. And with a suggestion or two influences the outcome. Right now he is just observing. He will make use of the chasm between Jon and Sansa. Hope Arya makes it to Winterfell next episode.
s07e01	It was a very good episode overall.My ratings- 7/10But it was more of a ‘build up’ episode .No such particular exciting events took place in this episode,but there were quite a number of smaller events that took place that will serve as a catalyst for the upcoming episodes.This has always been the formula for the GOT makers.They always have 2–3 ‘build up’ episodes in every season that helps in making the story more interesting.I will not go into further details as these would lead to spoilers for whoever have not watched EP 1 till now .Happy WatchingValar Morghulis
s07e01	Kelsey Hayes posted that she believes Euron Greyjoy still wants Dany. I agree: it struck me as “unfinished” when he told Cersei his dream since childhood was to marry “the most beautiful woman in the world.”What he carefully did not say is “…and that’s you, Queen Cersei.”Because I believe he intends to marry “the most beautiful woman in the world” - and he means Daenerys Targaryen.
s07e01	(Edit: Please note that my answer is written to answer a slightly different question, as above, before a merge)Epic. Awesome. Promising. Funny. Touching. Exciting. Epic.Everything I wanted it to be.Also a very good introduction for people who haven’t watched Game of Thrones before. Lots of explanation, maps, etc. — but if you’re reading this and haven’t watched Game of Thrones, start from the beginning! Then again, if that’s the case, why are you reading this? ;)Arya <3Am I right?!What an episode. I laughed and I teared up and I stared in awe.Poor Sam.
s07e01	The opening was impressive! Arya was awesome, killing all the freys. Like she's become a lot more powerful and she knows it. The scene with Ed sheeran couldve been done better without his cameo. Dany coming home was a moment I've been looking forward to for a long time. The hound is changing. Slowly moving towards becoming a follower of the lord of the light. Jon trying to live up to Ned and Sansa is becoming more like cersei. I didn't think much of Euron. But it's only the first episode! I think we ought to give him a chance! The mountain of dragonglass in dragonstone. That's another reason for Jon to meet Dany. Overall I'd give this one a 8/10. 
s07e01	It was certainly a good episode but i think it's major emphasis was on giving us a glimpse of what's about to come in the next episodes.Euron's prposal to Cersei,Daenarys landing in Dragonstone,Jorah asking about Daenarys,Sam's knowledge of dragonglass in Dragonstone, Hound's change in belief, Jon's argument with Sansa,Bran reaching Castle Black and Jon sending The Free Folk to man the castle on The Wall.All this is just a reminder of the events about to happen.
s07e01	I think that this first episode set the tone for what we should expect from rest of the season. There is going to be a great war in this season and this episode is showing who are going to be allies and enemies. And I guess that guy in Citadel who is in a cell when Sam tarly came near him. I guess that guy is some how related to Khaleesi. So that's it. It's good not saying it's great. It's just good. This episode is just information and nothing else.Have a good one!
s07e01	I think the objective answer is that it was a B+ or maybe B+/A- episode. Very good but not one of the best. There were no real surprises. It felt like a recap/catch-up.
s07e01	So far the critics are very good, I think Arya Stark will be the most valuable character for the new season! Game Of Thrones has come to an amazing point where we need answers and based on the premier, I think we will finally get to see the bigger picture. They usually make the most out of their premieres and once again they didn't disappoint.We've put together a list of the 10 most hilarious tweets about the first episode and it's a win for most of the Twitter fans : http://montrealgotstyle.com/what...enjoy!
s07e01	I enjoyed the episode at all levels. Even the Ed Sheeran cameo worked for me. As someone who loves the television adaptation of “Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy” with Sir Alec Guinness, I especially appreciated the conclusion at Aegon the Conqueror’s map table. There were also several good lines including my favorite from Sansa to Littlefinger: “We’ll assume you got the last word and it was something clever” or there abouts.
s07e01	It is cool.
s08e02	10/10I know that the episode is going to have its critics, but I think it was beautiful.Upon my first viewing, I thought this episode was a load of treading water and time-filling…as if they had 55 minutes to fill and they just had to stretch it out as long as possible, cramming as many characters as possible on screen to fulfill contractual obligations, including some characters practically missing from last week’s show.On my second viewing, though, I came away from the episode surprisingly moved in a way that few Game of Thones episodes have moved me that weren’t actually based on GRRM’s writings.The empty spaces, the silences between lines; the darkness and gloom between the candles and open flames are quite haunting, as is the fleshed out “Jenny of Oldstones” song, which is used to excellent effect.It is one of the most beautifully shot episodes that I’ve seen in some time, made all the more beautiful for the relative lack of CGI effects and eye-popping moments that the show is famous for.I really liked the way that the episode kind of seeped into my emotions; I felt like I was really there in that dim, firelit hall with the wind howling outside; or smiling with Sansa and Theon as they drank to the End of the World; or up on the battlements with Jon, Sam and Edd with the black wind right in my face. I felt Dany’s worry that her affair was going off the rails without knowing exactly why.While the episode is in fact basically about a bunch of people waiting around to die (as they tell us, time and time again throughout the episode), the plot does inch forward in various ways; with a couple of unanswered questions (Sansa & Dany and Jon & Dany scenes in particular, both scenes full of subtlety and honestly wonderful acting by the principles.)The trial of Jaime of course is a bit hand-waved: the show needs Jaime to fight the White Walkers and it will need Jaime later on in the season to bring the Cersei story arc to conclusion; but it was well played and well-integrated into the overall tapestry of the episode: by proving to the court Jaime’s honour, Brienne earns her spurs…This wholly uncynical development doesn’t really feel like GRRM’s rather punk notions of fantasy, but it is a moment that I, as an audience member, genuinely enjoyed. And Gwendolyn plays the scene of her knighthood with beauty and grace.What stands out in this episode to me, is the reactions and the expressions on various actors faces: Sansa’s guardedness when talking to Daenerys; and the unguarded joy and fear and sorrow she shows when reuniting with Theon, the foster brother who saved her life. Dany’s open and frank friendliness and uncertain haughtiness as she withdraws her hands from Sansa’s; Jon’s chuckle upon Sam’s joke at Dolorous Edd’s expense ; Brienne breaking down into tearful laughter; Bran’s piercing gaze; and Dany’s multi-emotional reactions to hearing the news that Jon is the rightful heir.These were all moments that floored me without dialogue.In the end, in the second viewing, once my cynical side was appeased, I found the episode one of my favorite of the episodes where nothing really happens action-wise, and there have been many in this long series or serial (depending on what side your on.)Bryan Cogman, who wrote the episode, retains his position as the best of the writers of Game of Thrones, able to catch in a few lines the essence of the characters and their innermost thoughts while somehow managing to suggest hidden depths and not-easily defined emotional themes without resorting to the rather cheesy, facile heavy metal cliches that Benioff and Weiss tend to fall back on.Like the ghosts in the song of Jenny of Oldstones and like the characters themseles desperately on the brink of death, I never wanted to leave this episode.Which is not to say I don’t have some …observations:I’m not exactly sure if “down in the crypts” is the best place for the women and babies to be when you are fighting against an evil ice wizard who can raise the dead. Just saying. I can see that plan backfiring. I have a better idea! Keep them in Davos’ Soup Kitchen making soup, I say. I bet the White Walkers don’t react well at all to a nice, steaming hot bowl of chicken soup thrown right in their faces!! Has anybody ever tried fighting them with hot soup? I doubt it! It’s worth a try, dammit! They ought to be filling the catapults with soup. Some general, Brienne.When Bran asks Jaime “how do you know there’s going to be an afterwards?” Nicholas does one of his patented “scalp movement” reactions. If there is ever a drinking game with Game of Thrones, that should be one of the drinking triggers. Along with Cersei’s iconic eyebrow, Brienne’s furious frown and Dany’s ten yard stare.I must say the fact that Davos has set up a soup kitchen kind of amused me, but it made for some nice scenes.I felt sorry for Dany a couple of times when Jon kind of brushed her off: not knowing what he’s going through, I’m sure she was wondering why she was acting like a passive aggressive girl. Well played, Emilia.The scene with the Hound and Beric “Dead already in the books” Dondarrion was a bit pointless but then….AAAAGGGGHHHH. MY EYES!!!!!!! Maisie gets naked!!! I’m sorry, but she will always be a ten year old girl to me! Good scene, I particularly like the shot afterwards during the “Jenny of Oldstones” montage with her looking pensively into the darkness while Joe Dempsie snores away. But still. Ew.Cogman really got Tormund right this episode. Show Tormund has always been entertaining, but Cogman finally gives him the pitch-perfect tone of ridiculousness that he’s always needed.Cogman also absolutely nailed Dolorous Edd (finally!) when Edd says (I paraphrase) “Sam the Slayer of White Walkers and lover of the Ladies. The world really must be ending.)Finally the song was just the moody centerpiece this episode needed neatly sewing all the characters and their emotions together with it’s moody melody.
s08e02	There are legitimate issues in this episode, especially with the pacing, but boy does it drop a bunch of super-massive revelations that are just as relevant to the books as the show.Straight from the outset, we see Daenerys in her full-on power trip. Her advisers should basically be asking to hear what she’s saying, because it sounds so much like Viserys’s rantings from season one. Also, we are given a hint about how much influence the obviously insane Viserys had on his sister as she was growing up, given that they’ve had detailed discussions about what they’re going to do to Jaime when they ‘have him in grasp’.Very important here is the transformation that Daenerys has wrought in the Great Hall of Winterfell. With Jon and Sansa in charge, there were long tables with one row front and one row in the back, so as to accommodate the maximum number of people. That indicates a consultative approach to decision-making which we did see from both Jon and Sansa.Now though, with Daenerys seemingly numero uno, the design of the Great Hall has just a couple tables for the high nobility and everyone else stands before Daenerys as a supplicant. Small detail, but the Devil resides in these.During Jaime’s ‘trial’, there are multiple instances where Daenerys literally goes full power-trip. There is a massive difference between seeing power as a responsibility and relishing exerting that power over someone in a vulnerable position. Jaime had no reason to come to Winterfell, none.He could have collected the two Lannister armies, gone to Casterly Rock and had a grand old time with no one left to oppose him.Instead, he came to Winterfell, knowing the reception he’d get, solely to honour his promise. Brienne sees that and so that does Sansa. As for Jon, he doesn’t care about Jaime’s past, though Bran correctly guesses that he’d murder Jaime if he found out what Jaime did to Bran.Jaime straight-up furnishes all the intel he has, no games and no leverage.The power trip is back and she’s doubling down.Oh Tyrion… What have these showrunners done to you? Once the brightest man in Westeros, now reduced to being publicly shamed for making uncharacteristic mistakes.He’s right. They were at war. War isn’t about being honorable, someone should have told Robb Stark. War is about surviving at any cost.Nikolaj Coster-Waldau putting in some excellent character work here. All he does is manipulate micro-expressions on his face, perfectly conveying the heartbreak Jaime feels over being trusted by someone other than Cersei, something he lived his whole life thinking to be impossible. Like Sophie Turner and Sansa, Jaime was a role that Coster-Waldau was born to play.At this point, it’s not even subtle anymore. If the show doesn’t do the ‘Daenerys as the Mad Queen’ story arc, then it would be mind-numbingly stupid to portray her character as being this annoyed at Sansa’s suggestion at what should happen.I simultaneously love and hate this scene. In this scene, Grey Worm is the slave soldier who has won himself a place among nobility and Jaime is the one born into nobility who has recently learned some humility. But, the way this scene is framed, I hate Grey Worm for shoving Widow’s Wail into Jaime’s chest. If Jaime had his sword hand, no amount of training since childhood would have saved Grey Worm. Wonderful framing once again from David Nutter.If it was confusing why Tyrion would turn around and say that Varys or Jorah might replace him soon, this scene is why. Daenerys makes sure to glance in their general direction when she knows that Tyrion is watching, to implant the suggestion in his mind. Tyrion, being brilliant, naturally picks up on it straightaway.If the Arya-Gendry arc seemed cut for time last episode, this time around, there’s arguably too much time given to it. How good is Gendry as a smith? He’s reforged what is essentially a form of volcanic glass into a weapon that can cleave wood.I’ll get to their sex scene here and dispose of it. Maybe this is just me, but it was really, really awkward watching the part where Arya disrobes. They don’t go full-frontal which is a damned mercy, mostly because we’ve watched this character on this show as a child and yes, she’s a grown woman by Westerosi standards now and there’s always the hint of an Arya-Gendry romance in the books, but still, this sequence is something that, for me, might have worked better as an implication rather than a visually realized scene.This scene.And Jaime’s reaction. Given by what we see later, there’s a pretty good chance now that Bran knows that he’s going to die in the Winterfell battle. That might be why he set the wheels in motion for R+L=J to be revealed as soon as Jon returned. There is all the reason to believe that there is a longer conversation here, but we aren’t told what it is.We can infer something from Jaime’s subsequent actions. After this talk, he meets Tyrion, his only relative in this gathering, and then spots Brienne and offers to fight under her. Could it be that he’s been told that he too is going to die and he can save Brienne and maybe more if he fought and died at the left flank? Personally, I don’t think he’s going to die at Winterfell, but this and Bran’s other scene with Tyrion don’t give me any confidence.Pure bullshit from Tyrion, proving that his blind spot for family is just as big as Tywin’s. Cersei fooled Jaime more than anyone else.Important detail: All the outward-facing ramparts of the outer walls have been lined with dragonglass spikes. Common sense strategy, and will prove useful in taking down the first few waves of wights. Once the spikes are buried in wight gore, then it’ll be a free-for-all.In the trailer, I postulated that this expression might due to her mourning someone’s death. Turns out, it was just because big ol’ meanie Sansa didn’t agree with her to burn Jaime.The power trip is back. Because we missed it so much for the two minutes we weren’t seeing it.Here is the mask of civility. We will see it come off, come back on and finally be thrown out the window in this sequence of scenes.Sansa puts a pin in her ‘blame Tyrion’ balloon. Daenerys is ultimately the monarch and Tyrion only makes suggestions, he doesn’t make the decisions.Mask off, but only momentarily.Mask back on.It is here that she overplays her hand, with the flattery.I absolutely adore Sophie Turner’s acting here. How she manages to pack so much contempt into a smile, I’ll never know. Sansa here is actually pitying Daenerys, because the latter is using tactics that the former discovered to spot years ago from Cersei. Sansa is the real ‘younger, more beautiful queen’ of the valonquar prophecy. This sequence should be all the proof that is needed.Sansa leaning forward here is a ploy, she lures Daenerys into a trap. Daenerys thinks that she’s swayed Jon’s uppity sister to her side, and Sansa knows that, and suckers her in. How she’s grown…And there’s the trap. Sansa puts Daenerys on the spot, regarding the status of the North in Daenerys’s hypothetical rule.The mask has left the building. At least, she doesn’t resort to threats, or she would have if Theon hadn’t just returned.Again, masterful framing from Nutter. We know what Theon has done and what it has cost the Starks. But, here, what we’re seeing is Theon’s core and lifelong desire be fulfilled. All he ever wanted was to be accepted and embraced as a Stark, just like Jon. Not for nothing that Sansa is the current head of the Stark family and he immediately volunteers for the most risky assignment, protecting Bran on the ground without Valyrian steel and dragons. I think the show might be killing him off in the next episode. To me, his arc is complete. He saved Yara and has been accepted into both the Stark and Greyjoy families. I think he’s a goner. Gilly and Davos’s scenes were both a framing device to see the war from the commoners’s perspective and a moment’s respite from seeing one major character after another.Beric, Edd and Tormund arrive at Winterfell, sidestepping the undead army. According to them, the army will arrive by daybreak the next day. The problem I had with pacing was with everything after this, because a lot seems to happen in the time remaining.The big planning meet-up is one of the biggest cascade of revelations ever.Some of the biggest ones are:The Long Night is cyclical, since there have been other Ravens, and none have apparently managed to permanently beat the Night King.No one has ever tried dragons against the Others.The true motive of the Others might just have been revealed. Not only do they want to transform the world in their image, but they want to erase even the memory of anything other than themselves.Bran is the world’s living identity. He’s truly a demigod.Again, we don’t know what Bran said, but after this chat, Tyrion is next seen talking and drinking with Jaime, who has also recently had a chat with Bran. I think Bran knows that he is going to die in the upcoming battle and is making sure everyone knows what they need to know.The Night’s Watch reunion. And of course, Ghost, who shows up in an episode with zero dragon action. I have a very bad feeling about Ghost now that Jon is bonded with Rhaegal. Don’t you fucking kill him off, David and Dan!Prime material from ‘Dolorous’ Edd here. Lover of Ladies, indeed…Remembering the fallen.I’m not going to go too deep into the fireside interaction, because that is pure filler material, with the exception of one thing.Brienne lies as a reflex, because she has been mocked for wanting to be a knight. It is all that she has ever wanted. Also, huge revelation alert, because Jaime calls her a ‘Knight of the Seven Kingdoms’. That title was last used for Lord Commander Duncan The Tall, whose shield turns up in the armory of Tarth in the books, implying that she might be a descendant of his, explaining her unusual height and strength. To me, this was a confirmation that Brienne is a descendant of Ser Duncan.Lyanna Mormont schools her cousin in bravery in the face of insurmountable odds. Jorah fled his potential execution and became a disgraced sellsword and a spy, whereas his cousin isn’t even willing to hide, let alone flee.This is Jenny’s song, named after Princess Jenny of Oldstones. This song comes up in the books when the Ghost of High Heart, possibly one of the Children of the Forest, asks for this song to be played over and over again. The Ghost is the same woods witch who issued the original prophecy of the Prince that was Promised, and told Aegon V on the show that he needed to allow the marrriage of Aerys and Rhaella. This is another hint that the show is going to the fulfillment of that prophecy.Barristan Selmy told her these things. And there we have it folks, R+L=J is officially out and about.This is the beginning of her downward spiral. She knows here that she’s not alone in this world, that she has one living relative, and in true Targaryen fashion, they’re doing it. And, all she feels is panic and horror, because the only thing she truly loves, the Iron Throne, is suddenly so very far away.The power trip is back. And now Jon, who was apparently the love of her life in what she told Sansa, is facing her ire. Notice the transition here. She starts, standing alongside Jon, bathed in candlelight. But here, as she retreats from the truth, half her face is literally shrouded in darkness now and she’s leaning towards the darkness. The foreshadowing isn’t even subtle anymore.The continued interplay of light and dark on her face. And now she’s properly angry too, that a male heir has surfaced. She loved Jon because she saw him as controllable and someone who was no threat to her.This group of Others is more notable by the fact that their leader isn’t among them. The Night King can see the future too and no doubt he has a counter-strategy for the trap that Bran has baited with his own life.Can’t wait for the next episode, naturally directed by Miguel Sapochnik.
s08e02	Spoilers for Episode 2 (Recap and Review)At least we’ll die with honor. Ser Brienne of TarthI think we might live. Hand of the Queen, Tyrion LannisterThis episode continued the string of reunions. Jaime, Theon, Dolores Edd, Beric Dondarrion, Tormund Giantsbane all hunker down and wait for the Night King. The episode decided not to linger overmuch on key plot points:A Speedy TrialDaenerys finally has the Kingslayer under her thumb. Only Sansa seems as upset as she. They bond over their mutual outrage at his aggression toward their fathers. Brienne vouches for Jaime, which settles the matter for Sansa, who trusts Brienne with her life. Tyrion tries to do the same, but Daenerys is fed up with Tyrion’s poor advice on Cersei, so she won’t listen. When she speaks to the Warden of the North (former King in the North Jon Snow), he replies: “We need every man we can get.”I expected more dialogue and drama, but the showrunners are streamlining storylines so that we get a good battle. Did I hear a collective howl when Bran uttered: “The things we do for love.” Folks, you were correct. Bran is not angry. Bran doesn’t consider himself to be Bran. But Jaime apologizes and wonders how things will be afterwards. Bran isn’t sure there will be an afterwards. The Bran/Jaime talk felt anti-climatic—a bit like Jon’s resurrection in Season 6. For book readers, this is as close to the Lady Stoneheart arc as we are going to get.Tyrion Keeps His Day JobI would have fired Tyrion as my Hand, but I don’t have a Jorah reminding me to forgive. Yes, Jorah would have been Dany’s hand if he hadn’t betrayed her, if he hadn’t gotten greyscale and so on. But he would have been a far worse Hand than Tyrion. She decided to keep him for his mind. She also doesn’t have anyone better. Jorah doesn’t command respect in Westeros. Tyrion is Tywin’s son. But Dany’s forgiveness felt contrived. This episode felt like too many characters didn’t act like themselves. At least Tyrion got to sit around the fire and talk with Tormund, Davos, Podrick, Jaime and Brienne while Tormund entertained the lot with his Giantsbane name, and Podrick sang a mournful “Jenny of Oldstones” song.Can We Be Friends?Daenerys reaches out to Sansa, talking about their mutual role in commanding as women. They speak almost like friends. Daenerys makes it clear that she has come for the Iron Throne. Sansa wants no part of it. She wants an independent North. Daenerys snatches her hand away. I sighed. Did Jon not tell her anything about Northerners? Did she really think Sansa would want to submit to her rule? Daenerys says to Sansa: “I cannot help but feel we are at odds with one another.” And that will remain as long as Daenerys assumes her belief in her right to rule remains absolute—above all other considerations. Others are not going to share her ideas.Theon’s return confirms that Daenerys will not be able to control how others feel about Sansa. Theon is allied with Dany yes, but he came back for the Starks. Sansa rewards him with a grateful embrace that reminds us of her visit to Castle Black when she met up with Jon. He directs his request to fight to Sansa, not Daenerys. Sansa has earned the love of her people, including Theon. Daenerys is appreciated for the good she has brought, but she is not loved.Ser BrienneThat was a nice touch—having Jaime knight her. Here are the vows from the show:In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave. In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just. In the name of the Mother, I charge you to defend the innocent. Arise, Brienne of Tarth, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.Brienne's moving momentI had tears in my eyes. Even if Jaime were to die in his first five minutes of battle, he has come full circle—a return to his knighthood. I wonder if Brienne will become a Lord Commander of the Kingsguard/Queensguard like her ancestor, Ser Duncan the Tall. Yes, this was fan service, and this particular fan loved it.What Else?I saw a white furry dot with red eyes. Was that Ghost? Is that the best you can do, D and D?Jon Snow, Dolores Edd and Samwell Tarly are the remnants of the Night’s Watch. I enjoyed that bit of bonding.Arya, the Hound and Beric Dondarrion reunite, with the Hound threatening to chuck Beric over the Winterfell walls if he preaches a sermon about the Lord of Light. We understand, Sandor—no one was in the mood to hear about the Lord’s will.Speaking of Arya— I’m glad Arya and Gendry got together for some pre-Night King romance. It was weird to see Maisie Williams out of her clothes. Arya wanted to have a sexual experience before she faced death. It made sense, but felt so cliche. Our little assassin has grown up.Grey Worm and Missandei want to go back to Naath, Missandei’s home. Will they? Don’t bet your paycheck or even your Starbucks coffee money.Theon wants to protect Bran in the godswood as Bran waits for the Night King, hoping to lure him in an ambush. I think Theon will give his life to save Bran.Oh, I Almost ForgotJon sprung the news of his true birth on Daenerys when she went to visit him in the crypts. That was well done as Daenerys struggled to find words to express her regret at Lyanna’s fate, not knowing that her dead older brother loved and married Lyanna. I was glad that Lyanna’s sacrifice was emphasized as she made sure her baby was safe with her brother Ned, while she bled to death, entrusting him to sully his honor out of love for her. And Daenerys realized that Jon is the male Targaryen heir. Before they can talk about what this means, the White Walkers arrive.I don’t envy Daenerys. She loves Jon, but a part of her is going to want him not to press that claim. He is walking out to fight death itself. Will a part of her wish for Jon’s death, then hate herself for such a thing? Which part of her will win as Jon commands his troops to throw everything they have at the Night King.Some of this episode was tiresome. Some of it was cliche. But God, it made me want to see the Battle of Winterfell so badly. I cannot wait until next week.
s08e02	Very disappointed. Needless to say, my comments contain spoilers for those who haven’t watched it.Now, a week later, I have just watched Episode 3. I’ll put my comments about 8.3 at the bottom.In both episodes 8.1 and 8.2, there was very little plot progression. The story seemed to be, let’s bring most of the main characters together, and have them like each other.There was very little advance of the story. I had expected that each of the season 8 episodes would be a complete movie, as the producers had promised. But nothing happened, except each character showing up and getting the others to like him/her.At the end of episode 1, a hooded guy appeared, and I assumed it was Jamie. After dragging it out, he took off his hood for the big reveal, and (surprise?) it was Jamie. That was the dramatic moment that ended 8.1.We knew from last season that Jon was the “rightful” heir to the iron throne. (Does anyone in a democracy like the US or India think “rightful” heir is legitimate?) It took the whole episode to tell him this. And then it took the whole episode 2 before he got around to telling Dany.Did you notice how often they said that the crypt would be the safe place. I think they must have said that 4 times, maybe more. They should have said it only once, to set us up, but saying it four times makes me think that all of the characters are very stupid. Doesn’t anybody realize that all those dead bodies will rise from their tombs as soon as the White Walkers arrive?We have to wait to 8.3 for the White Wakers to get to Winterfell? (At least I hope they will finally arrive; as I write this, 8.3 is 5 days in the future.)What I had expected was a great battle in 8.1 of the wights (the official name of the dead) and the north. Maybe it would end with the dead dragon enflaming Jon and Dany. Great end of episode 8.1. Then in 8.2, we would learn that they both survived, unburnt. Dany looks at Jon (who, like her, is now naked) and realizes that he is a Targaryen. Even so, it isn’t obvious how that happened. They slowly pick together the pieces and jointing figure out what must have happened. Then Sam arrives to explain it all, but they already know.The dead rise from the crypt and we see Ned once again. Arya kills him with her Valyrian dagger, and in horror at having done this, swears she will never kill again. And we think she won’t, but later she makes an exception (in 8.4) when she sees Cersei. She kills Cercei, then she takes on Cercei’s face, to take control of Cersei’s troops to help fight the dead. Eventually (sadly) she, in this guise, will be killed by Jamie who thinks he is killing his sister. That would be 8.4. (Maybe she is later brought back to life, but I suspect not.)That would have been an set of episodes 8.1 and 8.2 with a moving plot! I fear that now that George R.R. Martin is no longer writing the story line, that the high level we have grown to expect is sadly diminished.And now I doubt that we will have the grand finale that I had hoped for, one in which Sam gets a message to the White Walkers, and then bravely marches into their camp, surrounded by raving deads (the wites) who are striving to kill him but are restrained by the White Walker magic. The White Walkers ask Sam if he has indeed figured out how to cure them, and he says he isn’t sure but that he read something that makes him think that maybe he can but he can’t guarantee it…. One White Walker takes a chance and Sam stabs him just so carefully with dragon glass, simulating the way that the Walkers were made in the first place by the Children of the Forest. Then he shatters it when it is in place in the White Walker’s heart, and the White Walker turns back into a person. A large number of the dead instantly crumble and fall—those created by and enslaved to this particular White Walker. Another White Walker goes up to Sam and asks to be cured. Soon the White Walkers are all men again, and all the dead are dead again, and Sam, looking up at the sky, says, “The Grand Maesters of the Citadel were wrong! It is not going to be a long winder! Spring has begun!” And Episode 8.6 ends as some cherry trees sprout blossoms.Note added on April 28, after watching 8.3.It wasn’t just disappointing; it was terrible. I almost wish I had not watched it. None of the characters did anything intelligent. Mostly they just fought bravely and boringly. The battle with the dead lasted about 1 hour and 15 minutes. (The episode lasted 1.5 hours.). It wasn’t anything more than a zombie battle. The living were losing, until finally at the end one of the major characters manages to stab the top White Walker with a fatal knife (I think it was Valyrian steel, but maybe it was dragon glass). The White Walker dies, and all of the dead return to being dead.Why take an hour and a half to accomplish this? Nothing else in the story advanced. OK, a few secondary characters were killed, including the Red Witch. (Who cares?) Somehow most of the main characters survived, even though thousands of others died. They appeared to have been lucky. Deus ex machina.Even the special effects were boring. They entire episode took place at night, and most everything was hidden in darkness. That’s very convenient for saving money on special effects, but it takes away all of the potential wow.Fortunately for me, I am a Warriors basketball fan (my granddaughter danced at two games, once pre-game and once at halftime). Most experts expected them to fall to the surging Houston Rockets, but the Warriors won. So the day isn’t a complete loss.Sigh. I waited two years for this Game of Thrones season. I rewatched 7 seasons in preparation, and my judgement was that they were truly excellent. My disappointment so far matches my disappointment at the sorry ending of the series LOST.
s08e02	Late to the party again. But I do like to party. Let’s begin -Wow, they’re not wasting any time with this. To Jaime’s trial right away.And it goes as expected…. except, I have two problems with it:Why the hell did Bran butt in with “the things you do for love” only to not follow it up with anything? Just to scare Jaime? That doesn’t seem like Bran.I have to say this — I expected more from this. It just felt undercut.Jon is acting cagey with Dany. Honestly, I expected them to talk sooner. Not only is Jon acting childish this season, he’s also acting like a girl. I won’t talk to you and I won’t tell you why. What’s worse? It feels like they did this just to give it the last slot in the episode. Leave us hanging again. Well.. OK.Yes, Arya seems to be demanding a lot from Gendry. There is definitely something in the brew.Arya is asking Gendry about the White Walkers. Shouldn’t she be asking Jon? Have they really not talked at all? Does Arya really want to ask the one guy who had half an encounter with the White Walkers before running back, and not her own brother who has faced them twice? Hard to swallow.Jaime meets Bran in the Godswood. And Bran being cryptic again. Does he really not know what comes afterwards, or is he just teasing us? I am not sure.Tyrion and Jaime. I like this pair.Brienne and Jaime. Of course.Tyrion’s stupidity exposed. And yet, for some reason, Jorah is backing him as the smartest man? I can see why Sansa would say that. She’s seen Tyrion in his glory days. But Jorah? Tyrion has been nothing but a fool ever since he joined Daenerys. I’m sorry, but complimenting Tyrion’s mind like that seems like an oversell at this point. Plot convenience.Dany and Sansa. Yeah, this looks interesting. A lot to unpack here -Royce sees Dany, but seeks Sansa’s permission before leaving. Gives Dany only courtesy. Sansa: 1. Dany: 0.“He never should have trusted her.” Dany throws Tyrion under the bus. “You never should have either.” Sansa gives Dany a smack down. Sansa: 2. Dany: 0.Dany says “I thought you knew his sister.” Is she implying Sansa is wrong about Cersei? Or am I misreading something here?And here they go about having complicated families again. I know Dany and Sansa haven’t talked about this before. But this talk about troubling families is getting stale now. Could be just me though.“…who aren’t inclined to accept a woman’s rule.” Funny enough, Sansa has never faced that issue. So Dany’s attempt at an amicable opening falls flat. And Dany goes on to praise Sansa, although not without praising herself too. Trying to find more common ground, but again, falls flat because I am not sure Sansa is fond of Dany’s way of ruling.Dany is animated. Sansa has a poker face. Sansa, oh Sansa! Yeah!Dany goes in with another misinformed statement - “… taking it back from people who destroyed my family and almost destroyed yours…”To be fair, a significant part of the Stark family was destroyed by the Targaryens. Does Dany know nothing about what the Mad King did to Starks? She doesn’t even make an effort to apologise to Sansa for it. And Sansa seems to be judging her for it.“Now I’m here, fighting Jon’s war…” Okay, that’s it. Dany calling it Jon’s war might just be the stupidest thing she’s ever said so far. Can we give her negative points for this?Sansa lures Dany in, and drops the hammer on her. Stay out of the north! Dany finds herself helpless again. And it’s great to watch their expressions. I have to say, Sophie has come a long way, just like Sansa. What acting!Dany sees an ally again — Theon. And turns out that Sansa has a much more personal connection to him. *hug* Boy, does Dany look out of place here.Davos serves a girl with half her face scarred. Shireen callback. Coz that’s the only way to show depth in Davos? Why did they need to do this?Tormund and Edd are back! We’re getting closer! Fuuuckkk.The Night King is after the three eyed ravens more than anything else. Why? Is it because they can see the past? What else could it be? This is new. This is interesting.Dany went from calling Tyrion stupid to wanting to save his mind. All within a day. Huh?Did Tyrion and Bran even talk?Missandei has had enough. She wants to go home. Will Dany giver her a ship (S7)?Jon and Sam on the parapets look very similar to when they spoke before the Battle of Castle Black. Nice!GHOST! Finally!Wine party in Winterfell. Okay.Arya wants some. Oh well. As off as it looks at first, I think it’s about time we acknowledge that she’s a woman now.Sam gives Heartsbane to Jorah. So Jorah does finally get a Valyrian steel sword. Interesting.Jon picks the best time to break the news to Dany. Perfect, just perfect.Dany questions Jon about the legitimacy of the claim. Fair point.Jon assures her. Understandable.Dany immediately questions the succession. And Jon looks disturbed. He’s thinking back on Sam’s words, isn’t he?And. They’re here.All in all, I think we’re done with reunions. We’re done with waiting for people to find things out. Most things are in the open now. And all that matters now is the living and the dead.Anyone psyched for some dragon vs dragon fight? I know I am!
s08e02	S8E2: As usual, part review and part recap:We have a title now: A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. Love it.(We already knew the big battle was in the third episode. Were people really expecting it to fully start now?!)We go right to Jaime standing in front of Dany, Sansa and Jon. This unfolded more or less the way I imagined it, but I really wish that there’d been a bit more meat to it and that the wildfire plot had come out. I hope it does eventually. It’s too good to hold onto.I feel like they played “gotcha” here with Dany and Sansa, with Sansa seeming to agree with Dany at first. Will they get along after this?! Tyrion and Brienne both stand up for Jaime, as I would have expected, and it looks like they probably did hold onto Brienne in the last episode for this moment.I think it was fiendish to not only have Sansa go along with Dany at first but to have her to change her mind after Brienne vouches for Jaime. If Sansa had changed her mind just because Dany wanted Jaime dead, it’d look petty. This makes it look like she does have faith in Brienne.Dany asks what the “warden of the north” thinks of this. The way she asks, not only does it come across as if she’s telling Jon to rein Sansa in, but also like she’s trying to tell Jon that his authority trumps his sister’s. “Are you gonna let her get by with this?!”Jon says they need Jaime, so backs Sansa. Dany goes with this but you can tell she hates it.Dany stands up first but Sansa leaves first. Dany’s pissed at Tyrion for being either a “traitor or a fool.” She’s not really wrong? Dany gives Tyrion a warning that he’s gonna be sacked unless he changes things around.Back to the dragonglass forges. The weapons are coming along nicely. Arya shows up and is very openly ogling him, which is delightful. We find out the crypt is where the non-fighters will be. Gendry tells Arya he’s fought the Others and she starts asking what they’re like. Arya seems a bit too eager to fight for Gendry’s liking. Arya shows him she knows what she’s doing. Rawr.Bran’s at the weirwood and Jaime ends up being his mystery guest. Jaime apologizes to Bran! It’s Jaime’s turn to find out Bran’s a weirdo. Bran tells Jaime he didn’t out him for the window-pushing because he knows Jaime can help them.Tyrion wanders through the yard, seeing everyone making preparation. Jaime’s welcome at Winterfell is uh less than friendly.Jaime asks Tyrion if he’s sure about Dany and points out that Dany isn’t sure of Tyrion. I think it’s interesting that Jaime frames uneasiness about Dany in terms of how she treats Tyrion, and not how she treats Jaime.Jaime at least doesn’t think Cersei was lying about the baby. Tyrion gives Jaime what is honestly a pretty big putdown: He knew what Cersei was and loved her anyway. Tyrion already looks better in this episode than he did in the first one. It’s like he does better when he’s down than he does when he’s confident.“We’re going to die … at Winterfell.” We get the “girl’s mouth around my cock” story again. Jaime’s heard it too!Jaime sees Brienne from the Winterfell battlements as men train outside. There’s Pod. Jaime is deferential and polite to Brienne and compliments her on Podrick’s progress. We find out Brienne is leading part of the forces.Here’s Jaime and Brienne’s … reckoning? Jaime says he’s not a good fighter anymore, but wants Brienne to be his commander. This is probably the closest we’re gonna get to “I love you” for a while. It’s poignant and meaningful to both of them.Dany looking upset. Jorah pops in. He admits that he didn’t like Tyrion but defends him to Dany. Jorah alludes to some other suggestion and here’s Dany finding Royce and Sansa in the library.Sansa stands when she sees Dany. No one’s going to accuse her of insubordination. Royce looks to Sansa when Dany says she wants them to speak alone, instead of beating it immediately. He does bow to Dany on the way out.Dany has this sickly tight smile on her face and her hands are clasped. She tells Sansa she thought they were in agreement over Jaime and makes a dig at her advisers. Sansa says Tyrion is good.Here’s that damn line. The captioning in the preview was wrong and Dany really does say, “HE never should have trusted Cersei.” Rather than let Dany throw Tyrion under the bus, Sansa throws it back at her — “You never should have either.”Dany’s trying to make this a “girl power” thing. “We’ve both a damn good job of it from what I can tell.” Can you really?Dany asks Sansa what her beef is. Sansa tells Dany she knows Jon loves her, men do stupid things for women and are easily manipulated. Dany’s mad at it being implied that she’s manipulating Jon.When the feminist line doesn’t work, Dany changes tack and goes to the angle of, “I’m doing this against the people who screwed both of us over!”OH MY GOD. Dany tells Sansa she put aside the Iron Throne to come fight Jon’s war “alongside him” AGAINST FUCKING ICE MONSTERS and asks Sansa “who manipulated whom.” Sansa has this open-mouthed look like she can’t believe it, then says she should have thanked Dany when she arrived.Dany says she’s here because she loves Jon. Which is all well and good except … that’s not really the point is it?! Jon’s putting on like Dany’s doing this because she accepts her sense of duty and … that’s … not … why … she’s … doing it? Help?Sansa asks what happens afterward. Dany takes the Iron Throne. And what about the North? Sansa asks. Dany jerks her hand back like Sansa’s electrified, then Wolkan walks in and interrupts them. This all looks like Sansa was dangling something positive — her sort-of apology for not thanking Dany when she arrived — in preparation for this question. Like with Jaime, it looked like they might be on the verge of an accord, but: NOPE.Wolkan greets Sansa first but it’s Dany who asks “What is it?”Hey, Theon’s here! Someone else for whom Sansa can vouch. Dany asks why Theon isn’t with Yara. Theon says he wants to fight for Winterfell, and asks it of Sansa directly. Sansa rushes to hug him.Here’s Winterfell’s soup line. Davos is trying to get morale up and … not doing too well, but he’s trying. Gilly’s doing her part too, leading non-fighters over to the crypts.A little girl tells Davos she wants to fight, and Gilly manages to talk her into going into the crypt with her. Poor little kid.Here’s the Castle Black and Eastwatch contingents down from Last Hearth. They give Jon the bad news about the Umbers and Tormund tells Jon that it’s pretty much zero hour now.Tormund asks if Brienne is there. My lord.Jon is giving a voiceover as we see Winterfell making preparation. Then we see Jon and pretty much every major player around the table. Interestingly, Jon is flanked by Sansa and Arya while Dany is catty-corner and between Jorah and Varys. Jaime’s there, with Brienne. Sam asks the big question, namely WHY is all this happening? Sam makes a rather eloquent rumination on death, while the camera flashes to Dany (who killed Sam’s family) and Arya (who was literally part of an assassin-death cult). Bran says he want to lure the Night King to the godswood and Theon offers to stay with him.Dany orders Tyrion to stay in the crypt because his brain is worth more than he is as a soldier. Jon seems to think they’ll be using the dragons to take on the Night King.Tormund manages to be morbid and hit on Brienne at the same time.As Jaime was Bran’s guest in the godswood, Tyrion stays behind to speak with him in the library. Tyrion says he wants to hear about Bran’s journey. Is this … going where it could go?Grey Worm and Missandei meet up in the Winterfell yard. Missandei tries to tell some girls hello and they bail on her. Kind of sad. Grey Worm says he and Missandei have no place in Dany’s world after she wins. When he says “this place,” does he mean Westeros or Winterfell? I’m pretty sure this is telling us that Grey Worm is going to die. It’s always the “when this is over” bit that does it. I give these two grief for being a bit dull, but unless I miss my guess, this is the first time either of them seem to contemplate life beyond Dany, to the point where they plan what to do on their own after she has the throne. Is this significant at all?GHOST! WE HAVE GHOST!(Please God don’t kill Ghost. NO. I hear that CGI showing a direwolf dying is really expensive. Think of your costs!)Sam asks Jon if he’s told Dany yet. Jon has not. Edd shows up. It’s a nice throwback to the Wall, with Jon, Edd, Sam and the wolf. Jon says Sam should go to the crypts. With the shots so tightly focused, they could be at the Wall.Jaime and Tyrion are sitting in front of the fire. Guess Bran didn’t tell Tyrion anything, ahem, interesting? Here’s where that promo still of Jaime smiling is from. Brienne tells Pod not to drink. Half a cup only (sure).I like this already. And Davos! And Tormund. What does Jaime think about Tormund hitting on Brienne. “Brought my own.” Oh my GOD. Tormund has zeroed in on Jaime as his competition for Brienne. Tormund then proceeds to down his whole horn of wine. This is fantastic. More. MORE.Sandor’s drinking alone. Does he not know it’s more fun in by the fire? Arya sits down to join him. Arya asks him what he’s doing up here. “I fought for you, didn’t I?” Here’s Beric. He’s fine with having been on Arya’s list. Sandor threatens to chuck Beric over the castle wall before tossing him the winesack. Arya leaves, declaring them “miserable old shits.”Gendry watches Arya do target practice. He has her new toy! She likes it. Gendry tells Arya what Melisandre did to him and reveals that he’s Robert’s bastard. Arya asks Gendry about his sex life. Oh. OH GOD. Is Arya old enough for this? I was not expecting this. It’s … kind of hot? They better hope Jon doesn’t walk in. It feels sort of wrong because Arya is supposed to be this … uh, child? But she’s not anymore. You know what? YOU GET YOURS, ARYA. GET IT.I would love to know if the showrunners came up with Arya and Gendry having sex on their own or if Maisie Williams was like, “Hey can we do this?” EDIT: Apparently Maisie thought it was prank? Oh dear.Tormund Giantsbane, progressive gender egalitarian!Jaime knights Brienne. They’re all gonna die soon. Why the fuck not?! This is a great scene. It’s poignant and weighty and honestly unexpected. “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.” Rolllll credits.Brienne’s teared up and everyone claps for her. This is fantastic. Ser Brienne of Tarth. Fuck yeah.Jorah is trying to talk some sense into his cousin. Lyanna’s in armor and spoiling for a fight. Sam gives Jorah Heartsbane, in Jeor’s honor. I like that Sam frames the gift as being about what Jeor taught him and not as a guilt trip about what happened to his family.Dear God the hall crowd is out of wine. What song are we getting? Jenny of Oldstones! As he sings we see Sam and Gilly, Sansa and Theon, Gendry and Arya, Grey Worm and Missandei, and Jorah.Dany comes down to the Winterfell crypts and finds Jon. Whose statue is Jon standing in front of? It looks like Lyanna’s? Yes, Lyanna’s. “Who’s that.” Who indeed.Dany can’t square who she’s been told Rhaegar was with someone who raped Lyanna. “He didn’t.”Jon tells Dany who he really is. He seems to have added some new details? The whole “bled to death on her birthing bed” thing … has Sam been talking to Jon about this more off-screen? Has Jon been talking to Bran?“Congrats, Dany, you fucked your nephew.”Dany asks who told Jon this. Jon says it was Bran and Sam confirmed it. Dany is skeptical that Jon’s brother and his best friend are the ones who told him this.Dany drops the hammer. Jon’s the last male heir to the family. He has a claim to the throne. Aaaaaaand it’s dropped as the horn blows. It’s showtime. NOTE: The very first thing Dany says when this comes out is that Jon’s the last male heir of the house and has a claim to the Iron Throne. Her first instinct isn’t to embrace him as family (even in the way Targaryens, uh, tend to treat their family) or express joy that her brother wasn’t a rapist or seem like she’s happy not to be alone anymore. Her immediate instinct is to label him as a dynastic threat. Hmm.Jon nods at Dany, she nods back and they head off. Guessing to go get the dragons.Here’s the Night King and Co. now. EDIT: Took a rewatch but I notice the Night King isn’t actually with this group of Others. Guessing he’s coming in on the dragon? Eesh.Final thoughts: I really liked this episode. A lovely mix of throwbacks, new stuff and a few things (Arya and Gendry actually having sex, Brienne being knighted) that were pleasantly unexpected. Jaime’s “trial” was a bit of a letdown even if it broadly went the way I thought it would. Everything else though — the interactions, the voiceovers, how Winterfell is just heaving with activity, it was all done really well. I think it was inspired to leave both Sansa and Dany and Jon and Dany on a bit of a clifhanger until the fight unfolds. It ensures that there will still be a powder keg waiting to go off when it’s done. Dany didn’t come off as poorly as she did in the first episode — her anger and skepticism were pretty reasonable — but she still looks off balance. She went to Sansa (I guess Jorah told her to try harder to make inroads?) and it backfired, with Sansa not biting any of what Dany was offering. And Jon did what he probably thought was the right thing by telling her who he was; he may come to regret it though.
s08e02	The episode begins promisingly enough, jumping straight to the ‘trial’ of Jaime Lannister — no foreplay. Sadly, apart from Sansa and Dany exchanging side-eyes and Arya cashing in her V-Card (also no foreplay), this is as interesting as the episode gets. And even Jaime’s little trial lacks tension, since we all know in our hearts he isn’t going to die in the hall at Winterfell. Who is he, Littlefinger?While the premiere did a serviceable job setting the table, ‘A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms’ wastes time shamelessly trying to exploit our nostalgia for earlier seasons without advancing the story in any meaningful way — until its final clickbaity moments.I get it: a bunch of these characters are about to die, and this is the show’s last chance to remind us how much we care about them. But it seems the only way the writers know how to accomplish this is to have the citizens of Westeros get drunk, tell stories we’ve already heard, and congratulate each other on their character arcs.“Wow, can you believe how far we’ve come?”Yes, actually, I can. I’ve been here the whole time. Is this about to turn into an ’80s sitcom clip show? Did you guys blow that much money on fucking CGI?In a scene on the battlements, Tyrion repeats his old line about how he hopes to die: “In my own bed, at the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and —” “A girl’s mouth around your cock.” Jaime finishes the quip for him, and it’s hard not to interpret this as the show subconsciously expressing boredom with itself.A few thoughts:Speaking of Tyrion, one of the reasons I’ve soured so much on this show is the utter neglect of his character. Last season, GoT turned Tyrion into a total idiot for the sake of the plot; in this episode, we’re treated to Ser Jorah reminding Dany just how smart the imp truly is, as though one boring conversation is supposed to make everyone forget the past. I’m sure they’re setting up some kind of redemption for Tyrion, but it had really better be good. He’s been a shadow of his former self ever since he got sucked into Dany’s orbit.Meanwhile Sansa has only grown smarter and bolder. It’s just so frustrating that, by necessity, she must take a backseat to Jon and Dany, even though she’s a far more interesting and well-developed character. Dany doesn’t deserve the throne; Jon neither deserves nor desires it. But Sansa? She actually is what Tyrion once thought he was.Arya’s sex scene with Gendry is an example of how to demonstrate that characters have changed without simply having them make declarative statements about it. These two don’t squander their (potential) last night on earth talking about how much fun they used to have with Hot Pie back in the day. Instead, Arya’s hilariously blunt proposition reminds us of the awkward pre-teen crush she had on Gendry and we are induced to reflect on how different she is now. Also, quite honestly, good for her.It is maddening that last season felt so rushed, but now we seem to have an hour to blow on nothing in particular. And for all this wasted time, we couldn’t even get a few minutes of Varys trying to buck Tyrion up? Those are the kind of moments I’m genuinely nostalgic for!Ser Jorah trying to convince Lyanna Mormont to wait out the battle in the crypts is a nice touch. I’ve grown tired of scenes whose only premise is “wow, these two characters are finally meeting each other!” …but this one gets a pass if only because it was such a delightful little surprise. Plus Lyanna Mormont is that rarest thing: an adorable badass.Overall grade: C-
s08e02	A return to form.I wrote here about how disappointed I was in the lack of gratification all the reunions had. Winterfell nixed almost all drama the show had been building eight seasons up to. But seeing A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms it becomes more clear why. The first episode really was just a grocery list to be checked off, and the in-depth reunions came in the second episode. I don’t essentially agree with that decision - for one, a Hound/Arya convo in E02 felt devalued by their hurried encounter in E01 - but I am glad the writers understood upfront that these reunions needed time to breathe and have legitimate consequences. Also where the whole Beyond the Wall business relied on characters presuming something the audience very well knew was never going to happen, this episode harkened back to the old Game of Thrones. These weren’t characters acting foolishly even though the audience knows better, these were characters having learned and changed despite sometimes the audience knowing better.I didn’t quite grasp this nuance until now. Jon looks foolish for discrediting Sansa in front of Arya not because we saw the union between the sisters and he didn’t. But because Sansa has warned Jon a thousand times that she knew better and he still hasn’t grown into trusting her. Mirror this with a Jorah who discredits Lyanna and we can forgive him. Just like Jon (and Tyrion regarding Cersei) he remarks something, we the audience, know very well is never going to happen. But unlike them, this is Jorah’s first time. So we forgive him his foolishness and enjoy Lyanna scolding him the way she does everyone. That’s a subtle difference between much of Season 7 and the S8 premiere and all their rightfully critiqued plot points of characters doing predictably foolish sh*t and never learning and this episode.A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms delivered on the premise of change and growth and we got some huge emotions because of it. If you had told me three years ago that a Théon/Sansa reunion would do more to me than Jon/Arya I would have punched you in the face. But it did, largely because of Turner and Allen get to play more with emotions than Harington and Williams in their more reserved characters, but also because Jon and Arya fell into their old rhythms of big brother and little sister, whereas Tyrion and Sansa have grown so much since we first met them. The tension that came from Daenerys feeling left out by the intimacy on display was a nice cherry on top. This is why we watch eight seasons. So we can see conflict build while understanding everyone’s motives because we’ve seen their journey. And it resulted in great moments all through out the episode:Bran staying silent on Jaime’s heinous actSansa knowing about Jaime’s attack on NedSansa playing DaenerysGhost!Davos, Gilly and the little girlMissandei referring back to NaathBran finally spilling some beans on the Night KingThéon defending BranBrothers of the Night’s Watch reflecting on their journeyTyrion’s drinking partyArya realising the Hound fought for herSam giving his family sword to JorahArya taking charge of her sexualityPodrick singing and throwing Brienne a look when she says she doesn’t want to be a knightDaenerys reaction to Jon’s secretAll of these were emotional character beats that weren’t built on how stubborn or short-sighted they are, but on how much these characters had grown into themselves. With that, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms rewarded long time fans with moments that meant the world to us because of the characters. And the best, most beautiful one was definitely: a freshly knighted Brienne smiling.I literally want to look at that smile forever. This pure, unadulterated happiness from someone who actually, genuinely deserves it. Jaime casually mentions the oath of bravery, just and defend the innocents, but they’re huge themes in the entire saga. And for Brienne as a character to not only get that recognition in the story but for us as well as to realise how rare it is she personifies these noble causes, was truly a series highlight. If only this show wasn’t known for killing characters off…
s08e02	A late collection of thematic analyses, short takes, and Reddit jokes.Two warnings:Lots of commentary gets into future spoiler territory. Like, I could be wrong about lots/all of it, and I’m not relying on set leaks or anything — but the closer we look at the clues, the fewer surprises ahead.I’m going to focus on political philosophy, meta-narratives, and the hidden meaning of Jenny’s Song. Some will find this fascinating, but lots will also find it all a bit a dull. Buyer beware.Anyway, let’s start from 10,000 feet up.#1: Competing EndgamesIf I had to pick a list of source materials that seem to have inspired Martin’s writings, one particular essay would top the list: The Moral Equivalent of War by philosopher-psychologist William James.Its basic thesis is that war is useful for mankind, in that it providesa crucible/outlet for the “martial virtues”an engine of focused innovationa cause around which culture can unify…while also being hideously ugly and forever opposed to all the values that humans point to as uniquely and positively human — which leaves us with a rather stubborn problem: how to replicate all the good that comes with war without all the spilt treasure — i.e., how to come up with a moral equivalent.James had his own set of ideas (basically mandatory service in a Chore Corps), but most subsequent pacifists have been more interested in James’ framing than his solution, each having their own spin on the latter.Martin is one of those pacifists. The famous Broken Man speech from A Feast for Crows reads like something of a thesis for the entire saga. War is a sick game, and it’s the man and woman in the village just trying to raise a family and tend to a cow or two that are paying the price for a victory which is always more a matter of ego than anything likely to be useful to 99% of the war’s ultimate funders.Now, sure, the extinction event of a Long Night is a bit different. Maybe the farmer does have cause to beat his plowshare into a sword for that. But even there, Martin is clever: the walkers mean death to all, yes — but less in the sense of amoral disaster and more in the sense of reckoning for the sins of the 1%.The First Men, possessed by their expansionary ambitions, ran roughshod over Westeros’ natives, leading the latter to unleash a force which quickly outgrew their control. Just so, a family obsessed with dragons as a means of perpetuating power (who were also the sole survivors of the culture which created dragons as a means of establishing power) escalated the game of thrones, which is now culminating in the person of Cersei Lannister — i.e., someone obsessed with ruling the realms of men, somewhat regardless of whether any men or women survive to inhabit it.Ice and fire are thus the embodiment of our unbridled ambitions and thoughtlessness concerning collateral costs — of our stunning brutishness and lack of creativity in coming up with better ways to associate and govern.But here’s the tricky thing: do the showrunners see this grand narrative the same way?Martin’s endgame is bound to be structural and institutional and a little wonky: the game must give way to something like constitutional monarchy, and those who survive must develop some moral equivalent to war. But the showrunners — do they share in Martin’s philosophical depth?I guess what I’m saying is that I’m prepared to be disappointed by a comparatively thin and unsatisfying ending. While I still hope to be surprised in a good way, these last few seasons, while immensely fulfilling in terms of dialogue and spectacle, just haven’t felt as substantial.#2: A Story of Two SongsSo, Pod had his Pippen moment on Sunday. And it was handled beautifully — a lovely voice singing over a montage of those about to be sacrificed to the endgame gods, made more powerful by Ramin’s genius scoring.But why the specific song they chose?The first two lines appear in the books, part of an ode known eponymously as Jenny’s Song (one of two songs referred to in the books without a standard title). It was presumably written by Rhaegar during one of his artist residencies in the ruins of Summerhall — and its theme is important.If Rhaegar’s “song of ice and fire” (the other song referenced above) is our macro guide to the saga, Jenny’s Song is about human choices in a highly personal sense. It tells us what people do for love in a world bent on punishing acts of will that run contrary to the game.A bit of background:The Jenny in question was the commoner wife of Duncan Targaryen. In marrying her, Duncan gave up his dynastic rights (he had been betrothed to a Baratheon woman he didn’t love as a favor to Lyonel Baratheon, who had supported the coronation of Duncan’s father).This led to the first (short) Baratheon rebellion, which ended with a consolation prize of Duncan’s sister Rhaelle being offered to the brother of the woman Duncan spurned. (This union led to the birth of Robert Baratheon, who would lead a more successful rebellion later.)Duncan’s decision incensed his father, Aegon V, who ultimately settled on his other son Jaehaerys II as successor. But, surprise, Jaehaerys took his brother’s action as impetus for his own breakup — choosing his sister Shaera. (They had been betrothed to a Tully and Tyrell respectively, as part of Aegon’s scheme to favor political alliances over a pure Targaryen bloodline.)To make it a trifecta, Aegon’s other son, Daeron, also bucked his own betroval (to Lady Olenna) in favor of a life of banging a fellow knight. (Though it’s possible that Olenna pushed pretty hard for this breakup, as she apparently found the Targaryen family a little weird.)Aegon hated all this, but felt compelled to let it stand. He’d been allowed to marry for love himself, being low on the list of succession at the time, which perhaps softened him. And so Jaehaerys II became the crowned prince.Jenny later invited a woods witch to Summerhall, who gave the prophecy about “the prince who was promised”, which led Jaehaerys to marry his two children Aerys II and Rhaella (against Aegon’s wishes) to ensure said prince came from his bloodline. (Rhaella had wanted to marry a knight from the stormlands, but was overruled by her father.)Rhaella’s first child with Aerys (presumably) was Rhaegar, who was born the same night as the Tragedy at Summerhall.This tragedy is thematically important in a macro sense. While much is still unknown (on purpose), the gist is that Aegon, in his quest to bring back dragons, did something with pyromancers and wildfire that burned the hall down, leading to his own death, along with Duncan’s (thus widowing Jenny and ushering in the reign of Jaehaerys).(As an aside, there’s a rumor that Aerys and Joanna Lannister got together on the night of Jaehaerys’ coronation, and that this affair continued after Joanna married Tywin, possibly leading to Tyrion’s conception. This probably matters more to the books, but Tyrion being a Targaryen is still on the table.)Taking this together, Duncan’s decision to marry Jenny for love was one of the major precipitating events of the current saga, as it led to a bunch of alliance-fracturing, the rise of House Baratheon, the rule of the Mad King, and pretty much everything else that’s happened in the show.So, the song itself. It centers on an image of Jenny dancing with the ghosts of Summerhall in the manner of that scene from Haunting of Hill House — i.e., in a state of communion with a simple and imaginary world of love and warmth, in contrast with the very ugly and very real world defined by the great game.The theory is that Rhaegar crossed paths with that woods witch (now known as the Ghost of High Hall), who told him Jenny’s story. He then, in one of his trips to the ruins of Summerhall, wrote her song as a reflection of his own situation, envisioning a world in which he and his true love could enjoy that which Duncan and Jenny were denied, where summers and winters would pass and walls would crumble and all could pay that no heed as they danced on with their lovers. As such, it reflects his desire to abdicate and quit the game, while also acknowledging that quitting comes with consequences.This theme is everywhere in the saga. Rhaegar ultimately chose for love, thus spurning the Martells and causing the deaths of Brandon and Rickard Stark. Rickard’s daughter Lyanna also chose for love, crushing Robert, who married Cersei, who preferred her brother and ultimately killed Robert. Even Ned, who loved Ashara, married Catelyn because of Brandon’s death, thus giving birth to the son who would break a betrothal to a Frey, leading to the Red Wedding. Had everyone married for love in a healthy political system, much could have been avoided. But the ambition which gave birth to the ice (walkers) and fire (dragons) would allow no such thing, leading to the birth of ice and fire united (Jon Snow / Aegon VI), who is now tasked with breaking the wheel.But Jonno has Dany in his way on one side, and Cersei on the other — and the Night King to boot. All have their own motivations, none of which are really rooted in creating a world where Rhaegar or Jenny would be free to love, or where dragons and walkers wouldn’t be thought necessary.#3: Quick TakesThough I touched on this last week, I feel compelled to again point out that everyone in Winterfell has a collective IQ of 7. Bran is the most underutilized resource since the invention of birth control. Why is Tyrion the only one asking him questions, AND WHY DID TYRION GIVE UP AFTER EIGHT MINUTES TO DRINK INSTEAD?Everyone in Winterfell also has the emotional IQ of like -32 (excepting Gilly, and maybe Arya). These people would struggle to get jobs in customer service at Popeye's Chicken. I suppose it makes for good drama, but Jonno’s and Sansa’s approach to Dany were F- in terms of thoughtfulness or efficacy or any other plausibly positive quality. Jonno didn’t bother to qualify when he’d come upon this new information, and Sansa was needlessly antagonistic, etc. This isn’t good writing. You could bring up all the same tensions without any of these shortcuts.Also, while I get that the purpose of the episode was to give a few arcs a happy tinge before the brutality of next week, people really displayed some curious priorities. Preparing to die without words left unsaid is good, but is also a distinct second to, you know, planning to avoid dying.The Hound got in his cheeky line, but maybe this is exactly the time to be asking deeper questions about Beric’s experiences and his theories on what the Lord of Light wants — because bringing people back from the dead (as non-wights) is a pretty relevant concern right now.About The Hound — his other line about “might as well be at a bloody wedding”. Is that a nod that we’re going to see Robb and Catelyn Stark come out of the crypts next week? I think it might be.Speaking of the Red Wizards, when is Melisandre coming back, and is it going to be in context of a Gandalf moment? Also, will she ultimately sacrifice herself for the team to make up for Shireen? Hope we get good resolution there, whatever the form. Her thread with Varys was too intriguing to be left untied.Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is unreasonably handsome, unreasonably good at acting, and landed an all-time part. Good for him. The casting directors really nailed it on so many choices.Um, I thought this season was supposed to have less teleporting? How did Theon get to Winterfell in two seconds when his sister was going west around the island?Great choice in directors this season. Alan Taylor (of Mother’s Mercy fame) was brought in for episodes 1, 2, and 4 — which seem to be all the intimate reunions and emotional sendoffs (and likely burials). His little touches (like Jaime’s hand when knighting Brienne, and the focus on Dany’s face when Jonno broke the news) have been great.Similarly, bringing Miguel back for episodes 3 and 5 is super compelling. He’s already done some of the best battle scenes ever committed to film, and he’s got two more kicks at the can with even higher stakes and budgets.That said, allowing the showrunners to direct the denouement itself? I get why they’d want to — but are they really the best choice? (I don’t know the answer to that question, but I’m interested in how that conversation went, and who got in their say, and how it was resolved.)#4: Reddit Round-up(As fair warning, Reddit humor is largely dark and twisted. Not for everyone, nor should it probably be for everyone.)(Jokes aside, she is 100% going to fight a resurrected Stark.)(I’m sorry, but also not sorry.)(This user was like the 873th person to point this out, but I think the writers deserve credit for the long game here.)(This reminds me of Jim and Pam. Karen was great, and we watched Jim do wrong by her because he wanted Pam more, and we watched Pam accept Jim even though he was a prolific boundary-crosser and general slacker. While Jaime has had a great arc, we can see from his recent scenes with Tyrion and Edmure that he’s still all kinds of messed up. Brienne can do better, and Tormund is an all-around catch. But, yes, sure, fine, I’ll be cheering for Jaime-Brienne anyway.)(Also the only lad with the stones to tell Jonno the bad news, and to defy his father. Sam has really been the Most Improved Player of the show.)(While the dialogue in this last episode was pretty good in the context of emotional resolution and fan-service, they really did foreshadow this one a bit too heavily.)
s08e02	Before I start this long review, let's celebrate the 5 seconds of Ghost in the corner of the frame - GHOST!!! GHOST!!! GHOST!!!The last episode was super-paced and this one was super slow. While the last one was the episode of reunions, this one was of extended reunions.Some expected events in the episode:Brienne spoke in favor of JamieSansa accepted Jamie and that was the look (Dany stared at Sansa) shown in the promoDany was really pissed at Tyrion. In the first scene, when he started to speak, it looked like she was going to beat him upArya asked for a staff-spear, self-pat on the back (Abhinav Sisodia's answer to What does Arya want Gendry to make with the Valerian steel and why?)Lyanna and Jorah fight. Lady Lyanna is not gonna sit out the battleSam gives Heartsbane to Jorah as his father taught Sam how to do the right thingDany was shocked as she heard the truth of Jon's parentageShe also deduced it in seconds what it would mean - Jon would have a better claim on the throne. And this is where the show creates drama, Jon could have easily told her that he doesn't care about the throne, but that line is never spoken and episode ends with the arrival of NKSome un-expected events in the episode:Bran didn't spoke out for Jamie; the wildfire plot remains hidden and truth of Jaime killing Aerys would never be knownBrienne was knighted by Jamie, that was emotionalPod is a good singer and his rendition of "Jenny of oldstones" was a nice touch along with the montageArya and Gendry had sex. Never would have anticipated thatDany and Sansa scene was my favorite. They both shared some laughs and were to the point. Dany started it nicely with smiles and compliments and Sansa assured her that Jon loves her. Dany laid out what she felt and what she wants from Sansa and Sansa ended with what she wants from Dany. At least, it's all out in the open. No more speculations. Detailed answer here - Abhinav Sisodia's answer to What did you think of the Daenerys/Sansa reconciliation scene?Question remains now is that would Dany agree to what Sansa wants or we would have a civil war after the battle with DeadAnd "oh snap" moment, the line was "He (Tyrion) should have never trusted Cersei; You never should have either", so Sansa clapped back in Tyrion's defense, not on her own. That hurtComing to the character-wise review:Dany - This episode was hard on her.Jon avoided her during the entire episode and then dropped the R+L=J bomb on her in the endHer hand has fucked up for the umpteenth timeTried to make friends with Sansa and was told her that they could be a happy family only if Dany gives up her claim on the NorthEveryone who arrives at Winterfell seems to gravitate towards Sansa (Jaime and Theon)Sansa -She accepted Jaime on Brienne's word. That was mature of herHer scene with Dany was nicely doneTheon and her scenes were quite tender and makes you wonder if the show is building up to something hereArya -She continued with her flirting with Gendry and took it to conclusion by the endHer "I know death" scene was even more badass than I thought, and she knows how to flirt around Gendry (my weapon? Yes mam, right on it). The way their dynamics work is cute, she knows how to push his buttonsHad a mini-reunion with Hound and Beric as wellJon - Not much to do in the episode except brood and reminisce about good old times with his NW brothers - Sam and EddHis reveal to Dany was expected but his surprise at Dany's deduction (that he has a better claim) was a bit strange. Sam has spelled it out for him in the last episode, so was he surprised that Dany figured it out so quickly, or he just loves to be surprised?Random points"How do you know there is an afterwards? " - curtains for poor Jamie?Tyrion looked really unsure of himself and it was sad to see him so down. "Tyrion is working with Cersei" theory can die nowDragonglass spikes on walls was a good touchLot of sweet Jamie-Brienne momentShe vouched for himJamie sought her out on the grounds to offer his services under her commandJamie knighted BrienneThe girl with burned cheek - reminded Davos of ShireenImpressive war council - almost every key player and some minor ones as well (hello Lady Karstark) were presentNK is coming for Bran and he would be alone in the godswood as a bait. Maybe that's where Jon rushes with his men as shown in the season 8 trailerWhat would be the bittersweet ending for Grey Worm and Missandei? Would they survive and live our their days in Naath or one of them would die in the battle?Jamie-Brienne-Tyrion-Pod having a drink while Davos warms his balls - never thought I would write this senetenceThings got really awkward after Tormund gets into the details of his name and source of his strengthArya's realization that she can shoot arrows or better, have sex, than sit with two miserable old shits
s08e02	S08E02: This episode could have been shot in 20 min. Rest all was unnecessary.Key points in the episodes were:Jaime’s Trial - The whole scene was well shot. The way Brienne stands between Jaime & the jury depicts that she was ready to protect Jaime with her life the same way Jaime stood between her & the bear. The only thing that was out of track is Sansa’s strong trust towards Brienne.War Council - A lot of information could have been spilled by Jon to better fight the White Walkers. He only said that Night King’s demise will result in their victory. He could have told the hierarchy of walkers. Night King -||- White Walkers(Craster’s Baby) -||- Wights. Focusing on killing white walers should also be one of the major points in the meeting as it would result in the fall of the wights created by those walkers. It was interesting that there had a private talk between Bran & Tyrion as this could be pivotal in the coming episode. I’m sure that Bran is going to die next episode & the info that he shared with Tyrion will change the course of the battle.Jenny of the Oldstone song - Well, this was unexpected in a good way. They have filled the rest of the lyrics of the original 2 lines of the song written by GRRM. Jenny the Oldstone was supposed to be written by Rheghar himself about the tragedy of Summerhall. Who died in the tragedy apart from Aegon the Vth & his firstborn Duncan Targaryen? - Duncan the Tall, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard - who is supposed to be the predecessor of Brienne. And guess what, who was born on that day in Summerhall, Jon’s dad Rheghar Targaryen. The song was well placed between the scenes of Brienne being Knighted & Jon revealing his parentage.Jon revealing his parentage to Dany
s08e02	This episode felt like an old BioWare RPG right before the last boss fight: lots of leveled-up characters with complicated histories having slightly-stilted conversations with zingy one-liners. I loved it.A few notes:Dany’s theatrics with Jaime show how much she sees this as the Dany Show, and it’s all about her connection to/claim on the Iron Throne. It was a nice moment for Brienne to stand up for someone that deserved it and a stupid way for Dany to waste time and political capital. Wish Brienne had whipped out Oathkeeper, but I guess it’d be awkward explaining where that Valyrian steel came from.Like a lot of the characters in this episode it’s interesting that Ice is, technically, back in Winterfell if not in one piece: Jaime has Widow’s Wail and Brienne has Oathkeeper.Glad to see the show remembers that Ghost exists right before Ghost will eat up the last of the wolfy CGI budget and die a heroic death.I don’t really get the building up of Tyrion by Jorah and Dany. It rings especially hollow after Tyrion assures Jaime that “this one is different”. Like really Tyrion how many times are you going to be wrong. It makes me think that the show has something big left for Tyrion to do but I just can’t see how or more importantly why.Dany’s talk with Sansa went about as expected and I just loved Sansa’s no-bs approach to “what about the North”.Where TF is Howland Reed? If there was ever a time I expected to see him, it’d be now. Maybe he’ll show up when it’s time to vouch for Jon’s claim but honestly I expected him to be here sooner given that the Starks called their banners.I appreciated the emphasis on the brother of Gregor talking to the guy who was killed by Gregor next to the assassin who wants to kill Gregor… almost makes me think we’re going to see Gregor get in a fight with someone again.Bran is wooden and boring and perhaps too close to deus ex omniscience for anyone to have an interesting conversation with him. I wish I could get excited thinking about the conversation he had with Tyrion.Tormund Giantsbane stole the show of course because he’s the best character.I enjoyed Arya’s scenes with Gendry but I still don’t quite get why Gendry of all people arrives back at Winterfell but isn’t making Valyrian steel, given the auspiciousness of his apprenticeship.Loved seeing Tyrion pour his old squire an overflowing cup of wine.I’d bet Jaime’s a POV character if this part of the story ever hits print.I tried counting the White Walkers  in that shot and got to 10, and I can’t remember how many (from 13) there are supposed to be now. Seems very intentional though and I wish I understood what the 13 significance was.The last shot was a nice callback to Tyrion pissing over The Wall in S1. I wonder how literal it was.Things I am skeptical about:Bran’s plan to lure in the Night King. What could go wrong there, eh?!The crypt being the safest place… after it was explicitly said on the show it was the safest place like 10 times.The dragons being useful.Who makes it through the Battle for Winterfell?Protected By Unfinished Business: The Hound, Jaime, Sansa, Varys, Jon, Dany, Drogon & Tyrion (per the show building him up at least)Not Safe But Has A Lot Of Interesting Stuff They Could Do: Arya, Rhaegal, Bran, Tormund (only because I can’t bear to put him in the next category) & SamPoised to die heroically: Theon, Jorah, Ghost, Lyanna, Grey Worm, Girl With A Burnt Face, Beric, Rhaegal, Brienne, Dolorous Edd, Gendry, Davos, PodrickWild prediction: Dany panics and takes off on Drogon to marry Euron.
s08e02	*Spoiler alert*Ok, where do I even start ?First of all, this is the episode we deserve, after one mediocre season and a little decent opening episode of the final episode.It was filled with emotions,stuff we wanted to see but not in a rushed way it have been for a while.Danerys becoming more and more Aerys is what we can see here. The way she treated Jaime was a little understandable, but the scenes with Sansa when she asked about the North and when Jon revealed his identity is perfectly showing how bad she wants the iron throne and that alone.Arya and Gendry getting some action. It was written in a way it can be rushed still we all are satisfied(including those two lol). Whenever I saw this two I always thought of the words late Robert baratheon, “I have a son, you have a daughter, we'll join our houses” , and this gave that words a little hope.Arya getting her weapon. Even though we don't know what kinda if weapon or how she gonna use it I was thrilled to bits when she asked for it on the first episode now I can't even contain the excitement now she has it. Also this makes me wonder whether she'll survive the night king or not. Her curbe has been on the growing since episode one I'm afraid for her life.The brothers United. Ever since Jon left for winterfell after resurrected , I was always looking forwad to the scene of him and Edd reuniting. I got that in this episode but it was even topped with the scene where Jon,Sam and Edd talking about the watch days. It was nostalgic coz it was the same thing they were fighting back then but just as brothers but now with different powers and titles.Lady Sansa, oh my word. Anyone who just sees her as little bird who made mistakes backs then are all who are seeing the show for the Dragons. The character development she had and still having is amazing. She's showing us who she's. She's a Stark. Her loyalty is towards the north and she's not gonna compromise anything. The way she says “We should let him stay”, The way she ignores Danerys in asking her to let Theon stay or Hugging and telling us she's not Cersei, she just learned things from her and she gets better and better everyday.I can write and write but I'll end up explaining every single second of this episode , so I'mma just compile little things I saw in a single point before I put down the main ones.Tormund hugging Jon surprisingly, hitting on the Big woman , Brienne getting Knighted that too in the hands of Jaime, moments between Missandei and Grey Worm, Sam and Gilly, Jorah's advices to Danerys, Little moment between Arya, The Hound and Lord Beric was hilarious yet we needed it. We caught a glimpse of Ghost, finally. Ser Daavos seeing princess Shireen on that little girl was too powerful and it shows how much Ser Daavos loved the princess.Now I'll list the few major things I saw in this episode.Ser Jorah getting Heartsbane. You might wonder why I didn't list this in the small things. But Jorah has always been a contender on the list of Azor Ahai Candidates and he getting a Valyrian steel which may become light bringer is making him as a strong candidate according to me.Night King's motive. From the very beginning we always wondered what the Night King wants. In this episode when Bran says he wants an “An endless night”, it makes us clear he wants all of the humans gone but we don't know whether he just wants that alone. Also I was wondering when the mark on Bran's hand was gonna be mentioned while it was done here.I might be over thinking this one but this episode where Sansa wanted the North to themselves make me wonder about Cersei's prophecy. “You'll be queen, for a time. Then comes another, younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear." All of other Cersei's prophecies came true except this one. You may think Margery did it but she definitely didn't seeing the way Margery is dead and cersei is on the iron throne. Danerys is a queen and she may do it,yes but the rivalry between these two and Sansa's growth makes me think.Saved the best for the last. Jaime's redemption arc. The writers may spoiled many things over the years but they never failed on this one. Jaime is redeeming himself more and more as days go by and he's getting mature. Can't stop myself from telling this, Nikolaj is making Jaime more and more lovable. The way he apologized to Bran, the way he Knighted Brienne, the way he acknowledged that he was not as good as fighter before, that he wanted to fight under the command of Brienne, I'll put my money on Jaime more than Danerys on surviving the Night kingAnd finally we can change the Winter is coming to the present tense Winter has come since the walkers are here on winterfell.Cheers
s08e02	It was brilliant from start to finish.This episode solidified my opinion that the show, since surpassing the book material it is based upon, may have some flaws with pacing and plotting, but one thing it does not suffer from is character. This show and these writers know their characters, and this episode does them great justice from top to bottom.This episode had virtually no plot development. The Night King and his army hangs like the Sword of Damocles over Winterfell, and the blow has not yet landed. Jaime had a brief inquisition which ended with him being allowed to fight alongside the living. As expected. Tormund, Edd, and Beric arrived from the Wall and informed Jon and company that time is short. As expected.This episode truly shined in the interactions between characters, which were all given appropriate time to breathe and were well framed by the impending doom hanging over everyone. No one held back, because there is no reason to. This resulted in several incredible character moments that, without that impending doom, might never have come to fruition.There's almost too many to go through, but I'll try:Jaime's Inquisition: This went about as expected, with Dany understandably angered by Jaime's very presence and disappointed by his news of Cersei's betrayal. Tyrion and Brienne spoke up for Jaime, with Brienne's vouch for him solidifying Sansa's position and Jon's realistic need for every fighting man he can get sealing the deal. It had to end that way. For Dany to have Jaime imprisoned and/or executed at this point would be catastrophic for her as a ruler of any kind.The Night's Watch Reunion: It was great to see Jon, Sam, and Edd together one more time. Particularly the banter between Sam and Edd. Sam has come so very far from when we first met him at Castle Black in Season 1. He has a family and deeds worthy of song, and Edd is begrudgingly forced to accept that Samwell Tarly is a verified badass.Also, GHOST SIGHTING!Sansa v. Dany, Part 1 of ???: This was a good scene. It wasn't as sterling as some of the others, but it hit all the right beats. First and foremost, it showed Dany trying to use something other than fear and intimidation to bring people to her side. She showed Sansa genuine warmth, and made a great point about how her love for Jon had brought her to Winterfell, not her quest for the Iron Throne. Sansa, in her own way, gave as much ground as she was willing to cede, but held firm on the independence of the North. And for good reason. She's suffered a great deal to be in the position she is, and she has become a great leader in her own right. If she is going to pledge the North to Daenerys, she will need to see action from Dany, not just words. Action which will no doubt happen next week.The War Council: The only thing that surprised me here was that there was no discussion of an evacuation, should things go badly (which they are basically sure to do). Otherwise, yeah, taking out the Night King is really your only play. Theon is definitely being set up for a heroic death in defense of Bran, which is the best way for him to go, really. He's redeemed himself with just about everyone except Bran, at this point.Arya + Hound + Beric: I don't think I will ever not love these two together. "When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself?" "I fought for you, didn't I?"Arya + Gendry: Genuinely surprised that they moved this fast with this relationship, but then again, there is that impending doom underlying everyone's motives in this episode. Although it was mildly shocking to see Arya in a sexual situation, since we met her at the tender age of 8, this was an important moment for her. This is the first time in ages that she has let go of the single-minded focus on survival and/or vengeance and given in to her basic humanity. It bodes well for her surviving the whole thing. Gendry, not so much...Lyanna + Jorah Mormont: I was happy to see them address these two characters. It went about as I expected a scene between them would. I doubt little Lyanna "Sassy Bear" Mormont is coming out of next week alive, however. The scene between Sam and Jorah that immediately followed it was excellent as well. Jorah's actions lost him his ancestral family sword, but now he's redeemed himself enough to earn the Valyrian steel sword of House Tarly.Davos + Gilly: This scene really hit me in the feels. The little girl in the scene was shades of Shireen Baratheon, and any callback to her, especially in the context of her warm relationship with Davos, will get me. I really hope Davos lives.Jon + Dany: All things considered, Dany reacted about how I expected. Unfortunately, much of the fallout of this reveal will have to wait, as the Night King came knocking in the midst of it. That certainly points to both characters surviving the carnage of next week. I think the interaction between these two now that the cards are all on the table will be central to the back half of the season.Tyrion + Jaime + Brienne + Tormund + Davos + Pod: These scenes were the beating heart of this episode. As disparate a group of characters as we've ever seen assembled, defending a castle that is not their own, in defense of a family who most of them have made war upon. The episode gets its name from Jaime's knighting of Brienne, which is arguably, along with his apology to Bran, the solidification of his redemption arc. I still believe he has one more thing to do (*cough* KILL CERSEI *cough cough*), but he comes off as a true Knight of the Seven Kingdoms in this episode.Was it slow? Yes. Was there very little plot development? Yes.Did it show that these characters are why we love this show? Absolutely.Well done, Brian Cogman.
s08e02	At this late juncture in Thrones, one could be forgiven for making like Metallica and reminding our heroes in Winterfell that “nothing else matters”. But in the face of an excellent slow-burner like this week’s episode, it is amply apparent as to why that view is wrong. Knowing and accepting that death is at the doorstep unsettles and levels us simultaneously. It is why we crave experiences we haven’t had, yearn for lost time with loved ones, correct past mistakes that were never acknowledged and strive to be remembered as better people than we ever were. Ultimately, it is precisely in our last moments that every little thing begins to matter.It is within this contemplative setting that the latest episode of Thrones plays out.The Last HearthThrones has often been at its strongest when focusing not on the primary players but the characters who surround them. And now that dragons and white-walkers have rendered anyone who’s not a Targaryen or Stark secondary, it is little surprise that this episode’s best scenes come without either of these families’ members.There are few faces in show-business currently on whom subtle changes in expression — be it surprise, relief or contentment — register as affectingly as they do on Nikolaj Coster-Waldau’s. The man is a delight in all his scenes, and it will be a sad day if Bran’s premonition about Jaime’s uncertain long-term future comes true anytime soon.Tyrion, Tormund and Podrick remind us of what they do best. This is, in order: getting people drunk, merry and comfortable with each other; recounting bawdy, over-the-top tales while maintaining a progressive, feminist worldview; and displaying yet another hidden talent, which this time does not involve a “magic cock”.But the shining light of this sequence is undoubtedly and deservedly Ser Brienne of Tarth. After soldiering on unflinchingly through several seasons of rejection, conflict and mockery, Brienne finds true acceptance in the exact manner that she craves and respects. Watching her experience true joy and finally smile widely has to rank up there with the show’s most satisfying moments.A Stark ContrastBoth Sansa and Sophie Turner come into their own in this episode. Having picked up tactical nous from Littlefinger and evolved from the meek, gullible girl that she once was, Sansa deftly susses the underlying manipulation under Dany’s friendly overtures and renders it impotent. Separately, Turner showcases genuine, unspoken tenderness in her scenes with Theon (the ever dependable and under-recognized Alfie Allen). Everything that they have endured and defeated makes their bond that much stronger, which is why it is a masterstroke by the director to play their reunion almost entirely off Dany’s face. Shared trauma, it seems, inspires loyalty better than either fire or blood.In comparison, Arya and Maisie Williams have a really poor episode. Despite her current prowess with knives and arrows and her torturous “training” with the Faceless Men, Arya never feels like she has come of age. Mentally, she is still a child. Which is why it’s first cringe-worthy and later plain discomforting watching her eye, seduce and get it on with Gendry, who is both older and much older-looking. This misstep casts the unwanted shadow of grooming on all of the duo’s innocent scenes together earlier.Two other things were jarring about this episode: the yet-again rushed, expository dialogue to reveal Jon’s parentage, and the show’s odd decision to seemingly use a scene between Missandei and two young children to suddenly address race for the first time after 68 episodes.The Long ConThere is something very deliberate about the manner in which the wheels are coming off from underneath Dany’s campaign trailer. Long hailed as the rightful ruler of the seven kingdoms, Dany seems increasingly ill-equipped for the job, as coronation day inches closer. And there have been signs all along that suggest Dany might not be what she thinks she is: from Daario and Olenna asking her to focus on being a conqueror to Sam casting aspersions on her character. As things stand, Jon has nobler intentions and a self-effacing quality, while Sansa seems more adept at matters of administration.It will therefore be interesting to see what the creators have in store for our Khaleesi: will they take the easy way out, having her seeing the light and become the ruler she was meant to be? Will they have her make the ultimate sacrifice and go out in a blaze of glory with the Night King? Will they be ballsy and have Dany become the final villain once the dust has settled? Or will they displace Dexter from the “worst ending ever” perch by having Dany retreat to Essos?Only four more episodes within which to find out.
s08e02	One of the finest episodes in the history of Game of Thrones.We have loved game of thrones for its laser sharp focus, sex, violence and interplay of an array of basic emotions. I am really glad the producers took some time away from all this, bringing almost all the major characters at the same location where it all began and just helped us understand them better.In my opinion what makes this episode so awesome is that it is the episode before an epic action packed battle where many are going to die. As the songs will be written by future generations for these heroes, the episode actually shows us so vividly why everyone is fighting and what exactly they are fighting for.One one hand we see “miserable old shits” Beric Dondarion and the Hound Sandor Clegane. They have fought all their lives and now as old men they are probably fighting a battle they fully don’t understand why they are fighting. Beric thinks it is the will of God but Sandor is simply hanging in there.Arya on other hand is young and has so much to live for. She wants to spend that time having sex, with Gendry. A night of passion before their deaths perhaps.The most beautiful moment for me however was of Sansa and Theon reunion. Both have together suffered at the hands of their captor Ramsay. They have shared a bond of misery. What is remarkable here is that while Dany’s subject Yara would rather go back to Iron Islands, Theon out of his pure love for Starks would rather fight for Winterfell and die. It is perhaps a lesson for Dany that the Kings, Queens and Lords and Ladies have to earn that kind of loyalty and not demand it.Sansa has suffered so much that she can not trust anyone. She can not talk to anyone. Yet, she shares a moment with Theon. It was both ironical given that Theon sacked winterfell and betrayed her family in past.There were many other reunions in this episode. The campfire that Lady Brienne, Ser Jaime, Tyrion, Tormund, Davos, Podrick sit around is another brilliant scene. Lady Brienne’s story arc completes at this stage. She is this strong women from the line of Ser Duncan the tall. She has struggled with her gender identity throughout her life. People called her lady but she wanted to be a soldier. She was gifted with the skills too and yet she never ever got the respect from any soldier. The only one to have given her respect is the gay king Renley Baratheon. When she gets knighted by Jaime, she gets the respect she deserves.Podrick is the one who finally sings a beautiful song showing us probably the skills that all whores of King’s landing appreciated in past.As the Episode 3’s battle gets all hyped, we are going to see at least some of these characters dying. I expect Brienne, Davos, Gilly, Sam, Jorah to die.Another noteworthy scene was between Jorah and Dany. Jorah has loved Dany so intensely that perhaps no one else has on this show. His love was not returned and yet he remains fiercely loyal to her and giving her some really good advice. It was perhaps his advice that made Dany go to Sansa to make amends.I am little conflicted about the scene between Jon and Dany. I was little surprised at Dany’s reaction to Jon’s big reveal. He is her nephew whom she has loved and had sex with. But she is more concerned about her throne rather than the fact that she is not the last Targaryan anymore. For whatever reason apple has fallen so very far from the line that also gave us Aemon Targaryan.One scene that could have been far better was between Bran and Jaime. It was too short.
s07e03	I’ve been a fan of the Lannisters since the first episode of Thrones, and you can imagine how much I enjoyed The Queen’s Justice. The episode had practically no weak points from a plot-development perspective, with everyone’s decisions making logical and political sense.The Boy who cried White WalkerThe scenes in Dragonstone were great. Having seen everything that Jon has, it’s easy for the audience to be naive and brand Dany an idiot for not listening to Jon sooner. But as Tyrion explains ever so patiently, it is unreasonable to expect her to jump on board Jon’s plan so quickly.It was interesting to see Jon adamant about not giving up his title; again this makes sense — if he went back to the North a lesser lord, he’d undoubtedly get flak from Sansa and have to spend time delivering boilerplate HR answers to his liege lords about how the change in his title was a mere technicality. Like I said in another answer, Jon doesn’t have the time for these distractions, and him standing firm to Daenerys helps his cause here. Jon emerges as the clear winner in this negotiation (thanks to Tyrion — whose side is he on again?), getting the Dragonglass he needs without having to give up anything in return.I also found the exchange between Melisandre and Varys intriguing. The scene left me wanting answers to several pressing questions — will Melisandre and Varys actually die in Westeros, and under what circumstances? Does Melisandre know Varys from before? And what is the secret behind Varys’ enviable tan?The Three-Eyed DickwadI know that the main takeaway from Bran’s scene with Sansa is that he no longer identifies as Bran Stark, and that he’s fully embraced his new life as the Three-Eyed Raven (contrast this with Arya’s arc). I further concede that he’s probably become desensitized given the scale of everything he’s seen in his visions. I also accept Tabitha Davis’ insightful point about this being the simplest way for Bran to truly highlight the scale of his powers to Sansa. But none of this takes away from the fact that he was a supreme dick to Sansa this episode; that too just when she’d started to realize her potential as a leader. #NotAllRavensAlso, did anyone else find it strange that right after Baelish launched into a strange monologue advising Sansa to visualize everything that can ever happen all at once, up stepped Bran who can literally do all that Baelish had just been describing?The Red DevilsWhat a fantastic episode this was for the Lannister twins!There was something poetic about Cersei and Jaime killing their children’s murderers using the same modus operandi that had caused Myrcella and Joffrey’s deaths (although Jaime did afford Olenna some mercy and the opportunity to make one last thorny barb).Cersei had flirted with the possibility of loving Jaime openly a few seasons back, and it was awesome seeing her throw caution to the winds this episode.Also worth noting, given the appearance of Cersei’s early-morning messenger, is that Cersei hasn’t lost her place as King’s Landing Trendsetter-in-Chief when it comes to women’s hairstyles. Remember an impressionable Sansa getting her hair done like a proper Southern Lady back in Season 1?Jaime, having initially been cuckolded by the ribald Euron (whose brand of villain seems to unfortunately be growing on me), regains his composure, and displays perspicacious military foresight to lay waste to yet another opponent and prevent the Iron Bank from foreclosing on the Crown’s assets.With four more episodes to come, it seems likely that, frustrated with the failure of Tyrion’s clever plans, Dany will heed Olenna’s advice and become the dragon. As usual, King’s Landing’s denizens will probably bear the brunt of the fire, but given their propensity for chucking garbage at women they barely know, I wouldn’t feel too bad for them.
s07e03	My disorganized list (which I apologize for).I loved the no-filler cut straight to Jon landing at Dragonstone. Now that’s what I call fast travel. Tyrion and Jon’s greetings were spot on, and in line with both men’s characters.Taking their weapons away was more than a bit odd, though. We have never seen that before, except oh wait, the Mad King, who forbade all bladed weapons in his presence. Foreshadowing or coincidence?Drogon buzzing Jon just as he says ‘I’m not a Stark’ to Tyrion. Sometimes a little subtlety is a good thing, dear showrunners.Tyrion and Jon broach the subject of Sansa’s marriage and resolve to let it go unspoken of, which is really the best thing they can do under the circumstances.The show cheated us out of Melisandre’s reunion with Jon and Davos it promised in the last episode, after she promised to reveal her secrets to Daenerys and Jon. Now that they’re both here, she’s leaving? Why? And why to Volantis? There are only two things in Volantis that could be of use to Melisandre in the coming war, one of which is the massed strength of the Red Priests of R’hllor, whose leader in the show is Kinvara. The other is the legendary Golden Company, a free company formed by the exiled survivors of the Blackfyre Rebellions and chock full of exiled Westerosi rebels. I hope they are recruited by Melisandre to fight the undead and finally restore themselves to the land of their birth.Melisandre also tells Varys that both of them are destined to die in Westeros, having been born in Essos. She is foretelling Varys’s death, but is this ‘a dying of natural causes in ripe old age’ death or ‘trying to betray Daenerys when a new Targaryen heir is made known, and getting burnt alive by her dragons’ death? I don’t know, but with every episode, my hope for a Mad Daenerys storyline becomes more justified. Could also be apophenia on my part, though.The best part of Daenerys’s conversation with Jon is her finally using her big power line, and not having to listen to it in trailers any more. What I didn’t get is why Jon didn’t mention Rhaegar’s “abduction” of Lyanna when he demonstrates to Daenerys that the Targaryens were the first to break the faith. Sure, we viewers know the truth of the R+L=J situation, but Jon doesn’t, and he should have mentioned that, especially when Daenerys talks about Lord Eddard being a friend of Robert.I voiced my objections with Euron suddenly becoming a conquering hero to the people of King’s Landing in the trailer itself, so I won’t repeat that here. Today’s Euron was a little less than the Euron of last episode, probably because he’s talking again. Still, it was amazing to see him wind up Jaime like they were actually brothers, and Euron was the prankster while Jaime was the upstanding one. In the books, Euron has killed more than one of his brothers and sexually abused two of them.Cersei killing Tyene with a modified version of the poison Ellaria used on Myrcella makes sense, until you look closely at it. The Sand Snakes, particularly Tyene, are masters at making and modifying venom, something they learned at the feet of their father. How is Qyburn suddenly an expert in alchemy and magic? At best, his areas of expertise are healing and a non-magical form of necromancy.I guess the incest between Jaime and Cersei is all out in the open now, and everyone in the Red Keep need only look at where the Sept of Baelor used to be, if they ever feel the need to discuss this with anyone. Cersei is ruling through fear, and Jaime is not only letting her do it, but actively helping her do it, as long as he keeps getting her. I’m losing more and more respect in Jaime’s transformation by every episode and Olenna echoes my feelings as she observes that Jaime is too far gone. If he is to abandon Cersei’s side in a future episode, I don’t see how that could happen without seeming incongruous and abrupt.Tyrion realizes that he’s landed himself the unfortunate role of the man who has to balance the scales between the Mother of Dragons and the Prince of Ice and Fire. He counsels both sides to stay, wait and get a better measure of the other. Jon is grateful for being given leave to mine dragonglass and in upcoming episodes, he will repay that in some way.Sansa is so freaking competent and cool as the administrator, and I love her in this new role she’s found herself in, as it suits her to a T. Littlefinger hangs around her, indulging in his monologues and playing games, and this is ultimately what will cost him his life. Yeah, I am convinced that he’s going to die. She embraces Bran in much the same way Jon embraced her, but it is not reciprocated. More on that here.Jorah is completely cured and ready to leave. Predictable, but not reasonable. Still, Sam’s reward is a pile of dusty old scrolls instead of an instant silver link, which sounds unfair, but those one of those scrolls contains proof of Jon’s parentage. Sam is being made into the show’s revealer of secrets, and the show may confirm that he is the writer and narrator of the books within the universe (as Yandel wrote A World of Ice and Fire). Bran believes that Jon is the illegitimate child of Rhaegar and Lyanna, so Sam would come up with the other bit of info, that Jon is trueborn and his parents were legally married.The fall of the Rock and the fall of Highgarden were events that many, including I, had predicted (more on that here). The death of Olenna, and the burn them all encouragement she gave to Daenerys, is the final domino to fall before Daenerys overrules Tyrion’s more considerate war doctrine and unleashes both the dragons and the Dothraki on the Reach lords who sided with the Lannisters. I expect the next episode to be the end of the Tarly family, as they will fall under attack both from land and air.
s07e03	(Show Spoilers) That was a good episode. I consider it the best in the season so far.Jon and Daenerys: I counted 8 titles for Daenerys while Davos managed to come up with one for Jon-King in the North. Jon realized that going south is never a good idea for a Stark. Certainly Dany knew the history of Torrhen Stark, but did she remember that there was another king in the north called Robb Stark? It was painful to watch her try to boss Jon around, as he wondered what kind of fresh hell is this? Bend the knee? Warden of the North? And we got that much repeated line: “I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.” I didn’t expect her to say that to Jon, and really, I felt embarrassed for her.However, I do expect the alliance has already begun. Daenerys must know that Jon will not bend the knee, plus Varys had to break the news to her that most of their fleet was destroyed. This episode showed that Jon is right: they do need each other. Cersei will not go gently into that good night, and Tyrion really does want Jon as an ally. It is very bad form to use guest right’s badly against a Stark as Jon is a prisoner, but he did convince Tyrion to let him mine the dragon glass. I sense the show is trying to make their relationship interesting to us, and that makes me very uncomfortable.Battle for Casterly Rock: I didn’t expect the Casterly Rock takeover to go so smoothly. Nor did Grey Worm. Euron destroyed the ships of the Unsullied, so Grey Worm has to keep Casterly Rock or else. I have a very bad feeling that Daenerys does not understand the word “fortification”. This was also a problem in the books with Yunkai and Astapor, when Daenerys was at Meereen. I sense the Unsullied are going to get picked off at Casterly Rock. I also was disappointed in the setting. Casterly Rock is a tall mountain that spells intimidation and power. I felt I was looking at Rivendell minus the elven protection spells. I hope Dany doesn’t take her dragons to King’s Landing. Instead, they should go to Casterly Rock and blow fire and blood onto Euron’s spitfires.Grey Worm is still alive.King’s Landing: Really, the people of King’s Landing are sheep. They are cheering Euron for what? Has Yara attacked their city? Ellaria was there two years ago as a guest. Defiant to the end, Ellaria spat at the crowd, while Yara just looked humiliated and frightened. There was nothing particularly likable about this section except that we were spared any gruesome violence. Even though I expected this to be Ellaria’s and Tyene’s swan song, I couldn’t help but marvel as Cersei’s cruelty: she poisoned Tyene and she will make sure Ellaria lives to see it. It looks like Ellaria will be kept alive for as long as Cersei is able. I expected something more violent, but I must say that as vengeance goes, it is probably very effective. I was further creeped out that afterwards Cersei finds Jaime for a roll in the sack. I guess vengeance and suffering gets Cersei excited—a bit like the Mad King. It was well done, but I wondered if Jaime understood why Cersei was suddenly so amorous. Did he know what she did with Ellaria and Tyene? Did he approve of the probable cause for her sudden interest in his body? Cersei did mention a queenly perk: now we can get naked and no one can say boo because I am the Queen. Maybe Jaime can live with that.Highgarden: The show’s need to cover two battles in one episode meant that neither one looked particularly interesting. Randyll Tarly was there. I hope we see more of him soon. The heart of the battle was the conversation between Jaime and Olenna, who admitted to killing Joffery while wondering how Jaime could possibly love Cersei. Show Jaime is really getting on my nerves. He actually seemed surprised that Olenna was the culprit. Had he really thought Tyrion killed Joffery? I don’t know what the show is doing with his character, but that just struck me as naive. He allowed her to be poisoned, and now we have lost one of the best characters on the show. She couldn’t wait to drink her death wine—good night, House Tyrell. Another score for Cersei and the sheep of King’s Landing.Winterfell: Littlefinger is flattering and advising Sansa, confusing her with actually some decent counsel—plan for all outcomes. (It also struck me as the show’s nod to Bran returning to Winterfell as he can see the past and the present, and possible future.) Of course, he means something else entirely, but the show didn’t give us enough time to figure that one out. The greatest part was seeing Bran and hearing his words that he needed to speak with Jon. We can assume he wants to tell him of his birth as well as what he knows of the Night King. Bran certainly freaked Sansa out when he described her wedding dress and told her that he regretted how much she has suffered. It made me realize how little I saw Sansa with any of her siblings, save Arya. Bran has changed. He accepts his role as the greenseer. He is sitting right by the weirwood, so I hope for some more visions. I don’t know how much help he will be to Sansa in ruling, however.OldTown: Yes! Sam got off the hook! He saved Jorah and got to stay in the Citadel. I was hoping for that, but expected a dismissal. Of course, he now has to go through a bunch of old documents to make copies. Will he find something about Rhaegar and Lyanna? Will he learn of a baby’s birth that has the bloodline of Stark and Targaryen? Will he find out more about Valyrian Steel as to why it is able to kill the White Walkers? Jorah goes off to Dany with Sam as a friend in his mind—-this will help Jon’s cause and probably bring the alliance between Dragonstone and the North into prominence.Foreshadowing of the Week: Melisandre told Varys that she will go to Volantis. Varys advised her not to come back. She told him that she is meant to die in this land, as is he. Will we find out Varys’ connection to R’hllor? Will he die by fire after ditching Dany? Will Melisandre die fighting the Night King? Will she help Jon Snow win? That brief scene was spectacular, and very interesting.I think this was a good episode. No, the show is not back to its early greatness, but the episode did what it had to do, and I found Cersei in particular quite impressive as she is not going to lie down and die for anyone’s convenience. There is something almost magnificent in her damaged evil. I hope Theon will redeem himself in the eyes of his countrymen, as I am tired of everyone failing to understand that he did the smart thing in getting away. I just want him to save Yara, as I hated seeing her as Euron’s prisoner, and really hope she survives.
s07e03	I’m apparently in the minority here, but I thought this episode was terrible. (In the event you aren’t interest in my old man rants, please skip the first two sections.)Thought #1: Why sort of secret leverage does Mark Mylod have?He’s the weakest of the show’s regular directors, yet he got brought back for two episodes in this short season. I genuinely don’t understand why. Of his four prior outings, three are rated in the show’s bottom 10 on IMDB (5.3 6.7 6.8).My main criticism is that he approaches every scene like he was doing network TV, which is to say that he doesn’t seem to think much of his audience. His winks are all exaggerated and his dialogue is maximalist in the worst way. Every scene in this episode was 30% too long and far too literal.Case in point, the exchange between Sansa and her advisors.Sansa: “Hey, what’s the longest winter we’ve ever had?”Dude: “I dunno. I guess I could check the standard almanac. But, hey, did you know the previous maesters kept every single raven scroll sent to and from Winterfell?”Littlefinger then does an eyebrow lift that would make The Rock proud, just to make sure we caught the foreshadowing. And we see that same hamfistedness in Olenna’s prediction of Jaime’s coming turn and the heavy implication that Sam is going to find something in the rotting scrolls. (I really hope at least one of these is a red herring, if only for the show’s dignity.)If you compare Mylod to someone like Miguel Sopochnik (who did Hardhome and the final two episodes of Season 6 — some of the finest hours that TV has ever seen), it’s like an All-Pro against a journeyman.Thought #2: Are the showrunners about to pull a JJ Abrams?They only had seven episodes to produce this season, and they had an extra three months to do it. Yet we’re almost at the halfway mark with little to show for it. I suppose the optimistic take is that what remains must be bonkers.My real concern, though, is that the lads in charge seem to be losing interest in the sorts of details that made this show great. The dialogue is still mostly sharp (when filmed well), but the plotholes and lazy oversights are mounting.Tyrion didn’t happen to mention the tunnels to Dany until after the attack force had left? He saved that bit just for some B-movie exposition while we watch Casterly Rock fall in like 12 seconds of cut scenes? Then the whole Olenna recap? I understand budget constraints, but it felt like a bad Scooby Doo trope where the villain plays catch-up narrator.Why were troops sent to Casterly Rock in the first place? It offers negative strategic value (leaving it alone would keep some Lannister troops off the board, as they would never leave it totally undefended). Is Tyrion really that thick or are the writers just not checking their angles?I never watched Lost, but I was an Alias fan. And I remember the feeling when the show began going off the rails (fatigue mixed with Abrams and co. moving their attention to the next thing). Given Martin’s stewardship, I doubt this will affect the ending here — but there does seem to be a lessening in the quality of thought put into how the final pieces are arranging themselves.Thought #3: Short takes about this week in acting.RIP Lady Olenna, the Lucille Bluth of Westeros. You died as you lived.Peter Dinklage is one of the finest actors at dialogue in the business. He always rises above his direction. The little inflections are just perfect.Davos is the earnest and lovable uncle we all didn’t know we needed.Jonno’s “but I’m a sovereign citizen” routine was adorable.Someone on Reddit pointed out that Bran seems like a guy who came back from Burning Man and hasn’t slept it all off yet. 10/10.Speaking of Reddit, got a chuckle out of this gem:What was Littlefinger rambling on about anyway? Enemies from every dimension? Plan with quantum mechanics in mind? Sounded like the sort of thing a fedora-wearing teenager would write and think profound. Also, he probably has the thinnest plot armour left. He’s going to scheme himself into the poor graces of two sisters who have grown pretty metal.Can we all admit that show Dany just isn’t very interesting? Like, I’m 100% behind strong female characters. Go feminism. But can you imagine sitting through dinner with her? She may be shrewd and good and all that, but a bit of personality that isn’t grounded in her origin story would be nice.Another thing about Dany: every melodramatic speech she gives is laced with nonsense. “I had faith in myself.” U wot mate? You burned yourself alive with dragon eggs because you’re all caught up on your Tony Robbins?At least Dany isn’t as bad as Bran. He’s been in a sled for months with nothing to do and he still couldn’t figure out how to explain his new powers without creepily referencing the worst night of his sister’s night? Yikes.“We’re all children here.” Jonno is right. No one on this show knows how to use their words to talk about their feelings. Everyone is a floundering mess of repression, projection, and unresolved identity issues.Oh, and speaking of children, this picture has been making the rounds. Was taken just a year before Season 1 was filmed. I’ve looked at it like 2,308 times and I still can’t get over how fast Robb and Jon did the whole Boyz 2 Men routine. Whoever did the casting is a wizard.Thought #4: The inscrutable desires of gods.The only really interesting thing to happen this episode (besides Jaime finding out that Tyrion was innocent) was the exchange between Melisandre and Varys.The Spider is a fascinating character. We know very little about him excepting what he’s told us about himself — which given how often he’s going on about mummers’ tricks probably isn’t very credible.But the Red Priestesses have his number somehow. Last night it was Mel with the cryptic line about them both dying in Westeros. But there was also that other scene from last season…This all raises the question of what The Lord of Light really wants and what role Varys is meant to play in his plans.We don’t know a lot about R’hlor either, other than that he’s not quite a passive deity. He wants something. As articulated by The Hound last week, Dondarrion was brought back for a reason. Same for Jon. And he seems to have a penchant for using messengers who’ve lost their faith (Mel and Thoros).This is obviously really spinal to the show’s grand narrative, but not in a way that’s easy to parse. Maybe this is some sort of Abraham’s Trial inversion, where the intended lesson is to say no when God demands something unethical? Maybe R’hlor is actually trying to encourage people to rely more on moral skepticism and historically-informed wisdom and less on ambiguous voices?Whatever his endgame is, we’ll find out soon enough. In the interim, we can ponder the implication of why Mel is returning to Volantis before she faces her presumed end in Westeros.Thought #5: The subtle genius of the saga.GRR Martin took Tolkien to task for building worlds that didn’t include any consideration of economics — which he felt left them as more removed high fantasy than the sort of relevant history-fantasy hybrid he favoured.All that to say that the scenes with the bankers from Braavos have been a real strength of the show. Human history is largely a study in financial incentives and the decisions they inspire. That Martin understands this so clearly is a core part of what makes the show so worthy of our reflection.
s07e03	#718Spoilers Alert !!This was one of the best episode of the season so far, now the game is really started. No longer a one sided game.The key scenes I liked, Show starts with Jon landing in Draganstone.The scene with Tyrion and Jon is heartwarming. Its nice seeing these two together again. They mention the new scars they have saying a lot has changed since “I saw you last pissing off the wall.” When they are walking up towards Dragonstone and before the dragons swoop down Tyrion inquires about Sansa, assuring Jon the marriage was a farce and was unconsummated. He also says she is a lot more clever than she lets on, to which Jon replies “She's beginning to let on”.Dragons swoop down. Tyrion : “Id say you get use to them, but you never really do.”The conversation between Varys and Melisandre plays out a bit differently. Varys clearly doesnt like her and doesnt buy her statment that she is done with whispering in King's ears. He mentions that to “us commonfolk, tasting influence is like a lion tasting human flesh.” She is going to the east but she will come back, which he mildly threatens that probably isnt a good idea for her sake. She responds saying she has to die in this strange land, as does he. She walks away and Varys is obviously left shaken a bit, since she just told him hes gonna die soon.So now the big scene of the episode is obviously the meeting between Jon and Dany. Honestly its a lot to take in theres a ton of back and forth between Dany and Jon with the odd time Tyrion chiming in as well as Davos. Biggest thing to take from this is Davos almost lets it slip that Jon came back from the dead saying he took a dagger to the heart for his people but Jon cuts him off. A later scene with Tyrion and Dany mentions some suspect to this, asking Tyrion what he thinks Davos meant by that. Tyrion is equally bewildered by it. The main thing is Dany is trying to strong arm Jon into kneeling and hes all like “seriously, this game is bollocks we are all in grave danger because of the undead.” she scoffs at it and they have a back and forth about their accomplishments in why they are where they are today. Dany retreads her entire journey we have watched up until now saying she survived it all because she had faith in Dany Targaryan not in myths and gods. Varys comes in an whispers about Eurons fleet and the greyjoys and snakes being killed or captured. Jon doesnt hear this but she offers them a room to stay the night. Jon asks if he is her prisoner.“Not yet.” she says.There’s a quick scene of Theon being holstered up from the sea by a surviving Greyjoy boat (not Eurons). Captain shows up asks about Yara he tells her he got her couldnt save her he tried. Buddy says he wouldnt be here if he tried.The Euron scene. Euron parades the snakes in the streets. Gives the “gift” in the Iron Throne room. Cersei is like REALLY pleased. The sight of them in chains almost like it turns her on a bit. She tells Euron he will have whatever his heart desires... AFTER the war is won. This is when Euron asks Jaime for sex advice.Next is the dungeon scene where Cersei taunts Elianna and kisses her daughter and forces her to watch her daughter succumb to the poison which can take upwards of a day or two or even within the hour.Finally A Stark re-union.Next is the scene with Bran coming back to Winterfell. This is after Sansa is running around giving orders being a bossman, suggesting to one guy who is making armour why they aren’t layered with leather since the weight and the fact its winter. Littlefinger takes her aside and they walk together hes doing his whole whispering in his ear type thing telling her to always think of every possible outcome for every possible situation therefore she will never be surprised and never caught offgaurd. Im pretty sure this quote is in one of the trailer.Then we get to Bran, he comes in on the back of a horsewagon of some sore. Something has clearly changed in Bran. He’s almsot like a buddhist type monk now. Completely emotionless and all wise. Sansa is crying a bit but tears of joy. Next is at the Weirwood where Bran says he needs to see Jon. Bran brings up how pretty she looked on her wedding night in the woods. Said he is sorry for what happened to her. She gets up and leaves and is obviously disturbed by what just took place.Scene after that is the Jorah one in his cell. He is completely cured. The Arch Maester is obviously suspicious and knows Sam did something. He leaves and says Sam needs to see him later that evening. Sam says Jorahs father saved his life and it was the least he could do. He asks what he will do now. Obv Dany.Now we have the war room at dragonstone again with all the players their. Tyrion begins his explanation about the invasion of Casterly Rock. Scenes of the invasion its a massive invasion or front but Casterly rock holds. Tyrion mentions as this is happening is that Casterly rock is more or less impossible to penetrate head on. but he made secret tunnles for his whores back in the day through the sewers to sneak them in.The Casterly rock invasion is actually the second last scene, and is narrated by Tyrion as its going down. He's essentially describing the battle as its happening. There’s an epic battle that focuses on Grey Worm as he’s explaining. Grey worm throws a spear at a lannister soldier that sends him 15 feet into a wall. Its dope.However as the battle finishes and Grey Worm and everyone is celebrating the victory grey worm is bit suspicious. He’s all like “There should be more of them” Then they get up at the top and look to the sea nad Eurons fleet is attacking Dany's and destroying the fuck out of it.Next scene is the aftermath of HighGarden battle. Jaime is marching upstairs to Olenna whos in her room. She knows her time is up. They have an exchange, says Joffrey was such a cunt. She asks how she will go. He mention’s Cersei wants her flayed in public, paraded around the streets. He tells Olenna he convinced her not to do those things. She asks will it be painful, he says no. Pours a glass of wine for the two of them. He puts poison in hers. SHE GULPS IT RIGHT AWAY. Its after she gulps it our Olenna gets the last laugh. She describes Joffrey’s death graphicly. Telling Jaime how hard it must have been to see his son die like that. Then she says she made it so because she wasn’t sure if it actually would of worked. She wasn’t disappointed. She says “He was a monster, just like his mother, and she will be the end of you.”Okaaaay so alot to take in and there is another scene where Dany and Tyrion are together alone in the war room where she asks advice in how to deal with Jon. Nothing really knew but I can elaborate if need be. Most important thing is she is suspicious about what Davos said about taking a knife to his heart for his people.There’s also the two other smaller scenes where Tyrion and Jon talk to each other at the edge of a cliff. And the scene where Jon comes to Dany as she is watching her dragons and she gives him permission to mine the dragonglass.Oh also, its the scene with Tyrion and Dany that convinces Dany to give him the dragonglass. The logic behind it is if Jon is busy mining dragonglass and fighting an enemy, even if its an imaginary one, it doesn’t matter because he isn’t rallying to go against Dany, so its probably better to extend an olive branch, create a relationship and keep him distracted so hes not focused and battling Dany.Overall, I liked this episode, the only thing I miss was Arya.Madhav Matle
s07e04	GAME OF THRONES SEASON 7 EPISODE 4 (THE SPOILS OF WAR)Jaime is disturbed by the revelation that Olenna Tyrell killed Joffrey. Also, he can now be sure that Tyrion had nothing to do with Joffrey’s murder. This and Tyrion’s obvious concern for his brother in the ending scence reveal that the show is trying to emotionally reconnect the brothers.Bronn and Jaime arguing is golden… like two teenagers fighting for their crush!Tarly father-and-son approach them at the same time when Bronn and Jaime discuss stranger things. Tarly disloyal? Hi-hu-ha!Dickon – MY LORD! Randyll – MY LORD! Bronn – Mah Looord.Cersei is doing good in King’s Landing. I wonder what she felt when Mycroft (Tycho in Game of Thrones) told Cersei that she is “better” than her father.Littlefinger is playing the “uncle” for the Stark children. And quite frankly all of this is disappointing. Littlecreep has been a really cunning character who always planned his actions. However, in the current season, he has accomplished absolute nothing so far. We will see but I don’t like where this plot is going. I am also uncertain why Littlefinger gave the dagger to Bran. Furthermore, Littlefinger seems worried about the Stark kids’ reunion and rightfully so.“Chaos is a ladder” HA! Be creeped out Littlefinger, be very creeped out!I am sorry Meera. Feel free to call me whenever you need someone to speak to. But in seriousness, I still do not believe that Bran “turned” completely. I still feel as if he is a Stark and cares for people who are close to him.Arya’s homecoming was weird. Sansa thinks Arya was joking about killing people. That’s cute! After Bran mentions Arya’s killing list, however, Sansa begins to worry. The character-development of both Sansa and Arya is beautiful. Both of them became what they had intended at the first place: Arya, a killer, and Sansa, a castle lady.Okay, back to Dragonstone: Missandei and Grey Worm did… many things together. Yeah, yeah, get to the point already.I firstly want to express the utter hypocrisy and the contradictions in the character of Daenerys. First of all, the scene where Jon and Dany are in a cave, Dany begins to dramatize things. You know, “long before there were Targaryens, Starks, Lannisters” and you think the show is trying to build something there. Then Dany proceeds to feed her ambitions and childishness “I will fight for the North… when you bend the knee!” Honestly, this girl really needs some reality check. Also, why is this arrogant scene under a really dramatic music? As if Dany is a really kind person who tries to help people but her hands are tied. Poor woman. Isn’t people’s survival more important than YOUR (not Jon’s) pride, Dany, regarding the bending of the knee?!Let’s rant on Dany some more: she loses the war. So what she does? She begins to blame Tyrion for it. Another huge difference between Daenerys and Jon (or even Cersei) is that the latter takes responsibility for his own actions. Not blames others for his own crap.The romance between Jon and Dany is, disappointingly, there. The cave eye-eating, Dany asking Jon’s opinion, Davos alluding that Jon stared at Dany. Yup, we all know where this is going.“She has a good heart.” Dude. It took you and Tyrion collectively to convince the “good-hearted” person to not attack King’s Landing and kill thousands of innocents. She doesn’t have a good heart. She has good advisers. (And don’t start with “Tyrion’s plans failed!”)Okay, enough Dany. The part where Arya fights with Brienne is beautiful. Sansa feels unease as she begins to realize that all the killing is real for Arya. I think this plotline is going to develop in the next few episodes and there might be some tension between the two. However, I do not think they will completely turn against each other.It is interesting that the Stark kids we liked at the beginning (Arya and Bran) have become relatively cold-hearted and blunt. In contrast, Sansa who did some stupid things in the first seasons is now a resolute and spirited character.C’mon, not even a single punch to Theon?!DICK-on Tarly. Your name is dick-on. Interesting: why does Bronn laugh at the poor guy? Also, it is ironic that Jaime doesn’t remember the lad’s name yet he saves Jaime once (and possibly twice).NO SCOUTS? AGAIN?!The battle scene was shot amazingly. No wonder where the money went. The dragon was also cool but the battle seemed kind of unfair. Was like watching a massacre.I really wish Jaime had two good hands. I would want to see him kick some Dothraki and not be saved by… well, dick-on.Tyrion finally feels the burden of betrayal. While to Daenerys, the Dothraki and the Westerosi are the same, Tyrion was born in Westeros and helping foreigners kill his former people is overwhelming for him. Seeing the havoc there, I wonder what Tyrion’s next moves will be.Bronn arming and shooting the catapult for 5 minutes without getting disturbed is ridiculous. Like the Dothraki soldiers are not seeing what he is doing?! Or they see it but, for the sake of the fans’ interest, they let Bronn shoot. Nice.The moment when Drogon was shot was extremely satisfying.Dany gets down with Drogon, Jaime is standing there, so what does Dany do? Gets down and tries to pull the spear out without checking her surroundings. Smart.“Flee you idiot. You fucking idiot.” Yup, Tyrion still cares for Jaime.SUMMARY:The Winterfell arc has been relatively boring. Tensions seem to break roots between Sansa and Arya. Keep an eye for it. Moreover, Littlefinger is in grave danger because of Bran and it seems like he is unaware of it.Dany and Jon have are being engaged in romance. This arc has overall been very disappointing and forced, so far. However, I believe it will continue to develop over the next few episodes.Tyrion’s not going to stay idle. He obviously felt wounded and I do not think he will continue to actively fight against Jaime. I smell emotional reconnection of Jaime and Tyrion.Overall, the episode was not written greatly but it was shot pretty well.
s07e04	“Bad things are coming.” Davos Seaworth, from the preview of “Eastwatch”.“Bend the knee and join me, or refuse and die.” Daenerys Targaryen, from the preview of “Eastwatch”.I watched “The Spoils of War” last night, but I wanted to watch it again before I added my review. It is a very good episode, the best of season 7 so far. It is emotionally very triggering. I liken the intensity to “The Rains of Castermere” from Season 3, and “Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken” in Season 5 for us sensitive viewers.I’m dividing the review into 3 parts: Dragonstone, The Kingsroad and Brandon Stark. This is probably the longest answer I’ve ever put on Quora, so please feel free to skim.Dragonstone: This is the setting for the return of Theon and the decision to fight Cersei. Jon has convinced Daenerys that the White Walkers are real. We see the spiral shapes on the wall along with drawings of the White Walkers.However, Daenerys cannot understand that her terms are unacceptable to Jon. He cannot bend the knee and lead his people. The trial and tribulation of Mance Ryder returns to haunt him. Jon offers an alliance and friendship. Dany needs this desperately, and already begins to rely on Jon when she finds out that Casterly Rock was a hoax, her best soldiers are trapped and as she tells Jon, she is losing the war. What does Jon say? He warns her not to melt cities and castles as she will be more of the same. Let her show the people what her followers already believe—she can achieve the impossible. Did she do what he suggested when she attacked the Lannister army? That is the question.And of course, we get the earlier nudge, nudge from Davos about “hey, you like her, right” along with the ghost of Grammar Nazi Stannis Baratheon telling Jon to use the word “fewer” instead of “less.” The setting for the romance is in full gear.Kingsroad: After defeating Highgarden, Jaime and Randyll leave the Roseroad from Highgarden, which leads directly into the castle area, onto the Kingsroad, which takes everyone back to Kings Landing. However, not everyone is going to get there.This is perhaps the most problematic part of the review as we all watched the episode, but interpreted the aptly named Field of Fire 2.O differently. I will give my understanding of this event with some recap, fully knowing that many will not share my views.Theon is shocked to find Daenerys gone from Dragonstone. Where did she go? She decided that she was done with Tyrion’s advice. She questioned his feelings as his decision to move the Unsullied to Casterly Rock, benefitted the Lannisters, not Daenerys Targaryen. Tyrion is going to feel the weight of her displeasure in which he is close enough to see the battle, but unable to influence it.I was reminded of Hurin from The Silmarillion, who is captured by Morgoth, the most powerful of the Ainui. Morgoth curses him by making him watch his loved ones with Morgoth’s senses, not his own. He watches massive destruction from Morgoth’s lair and can do nothing to stop the evil from transpiring. I think this analogy also will tell any reader what I thought of the ambush done by Daenerys, Drogon and her Dothraki.Daenerys speaks “Dracarys” and Drogon obeys. Men are burnt alive, and if they are lucky, they become ash in minutes. If they are not, they are roasted alive as Ned’s father, Rickard Stark was roasted in King’s Landing after receiving an invitation from the father of Daenerys, the mad king. Brandon Stark was forced to watch and if he tried to intervene, he was strangled. Tyrion must watch the Lannister army get destroyed as his heart is metaphorically strangled.Unlike Brandon Stark who was tricked, Tyrion understands that this is punishment for his poor advice. He sees the queen he adores become what he tried to avoid: she is a murderer now like Cersei who used fire to defeat her enemies and got a throne out of it. Will Dany get a throne for decimating the Lannister army? Something tells me no; the people have seen this before. They also have a problem with Dothraki who come from another land to kill a Lannister army. Even someone who hates the Lannisters is not going to be fond of what looks like a foreign queen using foreign soldiers who fight under different rules of engagement. Dany probably helped Cersei more than she helped herself.Some reviews have mentioned Hardhome, and I agree. Let’s set up the parallel without forcing the facts:The Army of the Dead attack when the Wildlings are trying to escape and go to lands that Jon has promised them via boats that will get them to the Wall, where they can find food, then settle on land and grow their own crops.The Lannister/Tarly army just fought in Highgarden under orders from their superior officers, completing the last part of the mission which is to take the gold and the grains into King’s Landing by the Kingsroad to avoid starvation in winter. Daenerys attacks the rear guard.Some of the Wildlings have fought the Army of the Dead. All believe in their existence. The Wildlings know how to fight. However, they cannot win against the dead; they can only escape.The Lannister/Tarly army seem to accept that dragons exist and they do fear the Dothraki. They are armed, but tired, and not expecting to fight, even though Randyll warns Jaime of a possible ambush. In both cases, no one expected the battle they fought. The casulties are staggering at Hardhome and on the Kingsroad.Jon Snow manages to escape with Doloros Edd and Tormund. He faces down the Night King, never expecting to see him. He cannot do anything, just look as the Night King stares back, then waves his hand. The dead Wildlings and Night’s Watch members who were known to the people in the boats are now reanimated into wights and under the command of the Night King, serving them in their death. Jon managed to kill a White Walker with Longclaw, giving rise to the belief that they can be defeated through the fire based metal. But we don’t know for certain as it hasn’t happened since Hardhome.Daenerys Targaryen has wiped out all supplies that she too, could have used as she counted on Highgarden to supply Dragonstone with food. While the Dothraki charge the Lannister/Tarly line, she flies up the Kingsroad and orders Drogon to fire. He destroys everything on the Kingsroad: wagon, horse, armored man. She destroys the supplies she needs to spite Cersei as she is in battle mode and angry. Jaime Lannister is hurting for his dead soldiers, while Bronn manages to injure Drogon with a Scorpion Bolt. Jaime looks at Daenerys, not as Jon looked at the Night King as he sees she is mortal. He only knows that he wants her dead. Unlike Jon who cannot move against the Night King, he tries to kill her, facing a wounded Drogon who would have killed him if ______hadn’t pulled him away in time.What do I see? Unfair terms of engagement. The Wildlings and Night’s Watch could not survive against the Army of the Dead or White Walkers, so they escape. The Lannister/Tarly army had the Army of the Dead in the Dothraki, killing them in droves. If they get away from them, they see the magical being, Drogon, ridden by the woman who claims to be their rightful queen. She has just destroyed all their food, and most of their companions.I don’t know what the show intends, but I think the comparison works. Magic is more powerful than humans. However, Daenerys is human, and she used a magical being to punish people who were doing their job—obeying orders. That is what soldiers do. I cannot fathom why anyone would see her behavior as rational. She destroys men and food to prove herself superior. This worked for the Dothraki who didn’t mind a burnt tent filled with Khals once they saw Dany on Dragon. However, Daenerys is not in Essos. She is in Westeros that hasn’t seen a dragon in hundreds of years.King Henry says in the Shakespeare history, Henry V : “ I was not angry since I came to France until this instant.” (Act 4, Scene 7) He is upset because the French went behind the lines and killed the boys guarding the luggage. The boys were unable to fight back, so it was an easy kill. Daenerys really did the same thing on the Kingsroad. She destroyed the humans guarding the food train along with the horses. Wouldn’t a few have sufficed? Furthermore, Drogon wipes out everything on each part of the road.It is one thing to ambush men using similar weapons. It is another thing to drop a nuclear bomb on them. Drogon is the hydrogen bomb that no one expected. There are lots of ashes now. I think the show is going to punish her by killing off one or maybe even two of her dragons. Maybe the scorpion bolt will get lucky. I expected this ambush, but didn’t know how wrong it would feel to me. The people of Westeros are screwed as long as their only choice on election day is Cersei Lannister or Daenerys Targaryen. I hope Jon doesn’t bend the knee.Brandon Stark: One could also call this Winterfell, but I see Bran as the catalyst for almost everything that happened, save Sansa’s displeasure at watching Arya outfight Brienne as she auditioned to convince Brienne to train her in arms. Bran is approached by Littlefinger, who is full of flattery and concern, stating his determination to be a caring uncle to the Stark children. It is laughable when one considers that Bran has escaped the White Walkers, lived in the wild, survived Theon’s takeover of Winterfell and now is the Three Eyed Raven. Littlefinger sees an impressionable crippled boy. Bran knows this and he is willing to let that mistake continue until the word chaos appears, in which he tells Littlefinger: “Chaos is a ladder”, eyes full of knowing. Littlefinger is properly disturbed as he knows he underestimated Bran, who refuses the title, Lord Stark. However, Littlefinger cannot even begin to fathom how off the mark he is, because Littlefinger thinks the White Walkers are nonsense, nor does he accept warging or greenseering visions. He is defiantly unmagical, a big mistake both in the North and among Starks. The show has downplayed the Stark’s warging and prophetic dreaming, but keep their keen sensitivity to human behavior. While Sansa guesses at the motives for Littlefinger’s gift to Bran, he has another solution.Bran sees Arya approaching Winterfell. That tells us a lot, which the show largely confirms. He knows Arya is a gifted assassin. He is aware of her list of names, which Ayra shares once Bran mentions it in the godswood, playing along with Sansa’s earlier notion that Arya is not particularly talented. He probably knows that Arya killed all the male Freys responsible for the Red Wedding. He knows the gift from Littlefinger is a sign of his own guilt in the attempt on Bran’s life. Bran refuses the gift in the presence of his sisters, passing it on to Arya, as he claims it is useless in the hands of a cripple. Bran is not the warrior of the full blooded Starks, That belongs to Arya. Bran has given his sister a mission: take the dagger and watch Littlefinger. I think we know how this will end.Sansa is not magical in the show, and it is easy to dismiss her as ungifted as she cannot fight like Arya, she cannot create battle strategies like Robb, she is not the three eyed raven nor the King in the North. However, Sansa endures. She survives and refuses to be a victim. Right now, she feels outclassed by her more mysterious siblings, and Jon is not around. Littlefinger will capitalize on this. Brienne may not see the threat to her mistress at first. Sansa is smart and a leader in her own right. Arya is correct when she tells her that the title, Lady Stark, suits her. That is Sansa’s gift: taking care of Winterfell as the Lady of Winterfell. Sansa trained to be a lady in Season 1, learning that all of that was bunk, until one day it wasn’t. She is not a preening female waiting for her prince. She is ready to assume full leadership of Winterfell while Jon takes on the greater tasks for Westeros. The Starks have come into their own. Littlefinger will be dead by the end of the season. You can take that to the Iron Bank.
s07e04	*WARNING**MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD**GO NO FURTHER PAST THIS POINT*Here’s my recap/review of this leaked episode of Game of Thrones:The ReachBronn’s back with his delightful jokes; always a win for me!Side note: Dickon Tarly’s armor looks WAY too big on him.Anyways, Randyll Tarly is discussing strategy with Jaime Lannister, which shows how good commanders they are.Meanwhile, Bronn is teasing Dickon for obvious reasons. I just feel sorry for Dickon, though. That is about the worst name you can get, anywhere.The following scenes are in my opinion considered the best battle sequence in Season 7:First sign of trouble: Bronn hears a sound that sounds like a tremor, and Jaime hears it too. They realize it’s the Dothraki and Jaime and Randyll start ironing up the Lannister defence.The screams, combined with the shadows, provide an epic visual and auditory ensemble before the Dothraki are even shown.Ramin Djawadi delivers again with the soundtrack as Drogon (at least I think it’s Drogon; can’t really see with Standard Definition) appears with Dany. Intimidating as fuck!Dany then displays her inner Aerys and burns the heck out of all the Lannister soldiers. Really makes you question if Dany’s really good or not.Side note: CURSE YOU DRY GRASS!Dothraki coming out of the fire is enough to make any grown man sweat if placed in battle and it gives me goosebumps just looking at it.The Lannisters still put a good fight, and kills a good 50 Dothraki. Too bad there are, what, 100,000 more of them.At this point it’s safe to say: gg Lannisters.Dothraki standing on horses while shooting arrows is badass.Back on Dany, who is looking absolutely ruthless and feels no remorse for what she has done. Her father would be so proud. She is just burning people left and right.Also, nice visual shot of Drogon burning stuff.Did Jaime really think normal arrows would bring down a dragon? Nope. And now Drogon’s really pissed off and burns more stuff.Side note: Aerys Targaryen is fapping to this in the afterlife as we speak.We see Jaime still being a good warrior even with a prosthetic sword hand. Armor does work, strangely enough.Also, another nice visual shot of Bronn sparring with a Dothraki. RIP the Dothraki’s horse though.Bronn then finally goes to Qyburn’s Giant Dragonkilling Crossbow and prepares to aim as Dany’s still on Drogon burning stuff.Tyrion randomly arrives on the scene and sees devastation. Is he losing faith in Dany now?Jaime looks around and sees scenes that will give any man who sees that on the battlefield PTSD. Seriously, it’s absolutely brutal.More visual cues starring Drogon! We also get to see a nice Drogon POV towards the smoke he just created. Of course, he burns the Lannister soldiers that are unlucky to stand there (or lucky that they are still alive)Cue to Bronn at the Crossbow who shoots and misses. Dammit Bronn, you’re literally the last hope of the Lannisters.Side note: Could Qyburn at least make a weapon that takes a shorter time to reload? Yeesh.Bronn fires again and it hits on Drogon’s right wing, and the dragon falls, to a stunned Tyrion and a pretty relieved Bronn.And for the first time in this battle Dany’s struggling. Oh, how I like these battles!Drogon manages to control himself though before he becomes a dragon-sized crater, and Bronn goes for cover as Drogon burns Qyburn’s Giant Dragonkilling Crossbow.Side note: DRAGON-KILLING 101- While killing a dragon by Giant Dragonkilling Crossbow, make sure to aim for the eye. That way the dragon can’t see.Jaime, in a last futile attempt, charges at Drogon as he lands on the ground, with his lance, as Tyrion watches in horror. What the heck is he thinking? Does make for good visuals though.I’ll say it again: Ramin Djawadi is amazing for the soundtrack!Jaime gets Bronn-ex-machinaed at the last second when he’s about to get burned, and with that all hope of Lannister victory is lost. He dives into a lake, and the episode ends.King’s LandingThe Iron Bank in the form of Tycho Nestoris is holding court with Cersei, and boy, does the bank look serious. Do not fuck with this bank.However, fortunately for her, the Iron Bank will support Cersei…for now.Cersei must be thanking the heavens that they took Highgarden.WinterfellWe now cut to Littlefinger who gives his dagger to the Three-Eyed Raven, formerly known as Bran Stark. It’s like they are two separate entities now, which is weird.Littlefinger rambles on about ‘chaos in the world’ and then the Three-Eyed Raven successfully freaks him out by alluding to his ‘chaos is a ladder’ speech back in Season 3.Meera then rejects the Three-Eyed Raven because he is no longer Bran.But HEY! ARYA’S BACK! Of course, she has to get past some spiffy guards, but she’s already done that before (back in Season 1)*STARK REUNION ALERT* Sansa and Arya reunite, and Arya at least shows some emotion. I kinda like this one since before their family was torn apart, Sansa and Arya’s relationship was really frosty. Shows how much things change.*DOUBLE STARK REUNION ALERT* Arya then meets the Three-Eyed Raven (also known as Bran Stark) and once again the Three-Eyed Raven demonstrates that he isn’t a hugging person.The Three-Eyed Raven then freaks Arya out, which is really saying something.The dagger that the Three-Eyed Raven has is then passed to Arya since the Three-Eyed Raven doesn’t really want it (and let’s face it; why would he want to keep it?)Brienne is now training Pod (side note: I feel sorry for Pod) when Arya walks in and asks Brienne to train her.Side note: Seriously? Arya needs training?Brienne anyway trains her but is really impressed by Arya, who coolly says that ‘no one’ trained her (I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE ARYA)Sansa and Littlefinger look over Arya’s training, and do I spy worry looks on Littlefinger’s face? It seems so.DragonstoneDany meets Jon again after engaging in girl talk with Missandei, and Jon shows her the dragonglass mines. He then talks about the Night King and gives Dany a lesson on what White Walkers are and why he needs her dragons.Side note: Is it just me or am I getting romantic expressions over them?Coming out they find Tyrion and Varys who tells them they gained Casterly Rock but lost Highgarden. Gotta hate those Pyrrhic victories, eh?Dany then goes full-rant mode and doesn’t listen to Tyrion’s counsel, which I understand since Tyrion kinda was at fault for Dany losing (almost) all her Westerosi support. Is this the beginning of their relationship breaking up?Jon tries to dissuade her but fails, and it shows the two contrasting points of view for Jon and Dany.Jon and Davos Seaworth then get into a conversation about how much men they have in the North.Side note: Davos finally learned from Stannis and knows when to use ‘less’ and when to use ‘fewer’. Since Jon knows nothing though, Davos of course has to teach him. Shireen would be proud!The duo then meets Missandei who Jon explains what bastardy is, and Davos takes curiosity as to how Missandei got to Dragonstone. Quite pointless in my opinion but I’ll take it.The trio then meets Theon and Jon’s welcome with him is a bit cold, to say the least. Remember, Jon still thinks Theon killed Bran. Anyways, Theon wants to see Dany but Jon says that she’s gone.Overall, HOLY CRAP. This is BY FAR the best Season 7 episode, and I’d be willing to rank it inside my Top 10 Favourite Episodes of all time. We have two Stark reunions, a very impressive battle sequence, all coupled with the soundtrack magic of Ramin Djawadi. A must-see!
s07e04	It’s fun how everything is playing out like a fan fiction now instead of the “errybody gets raped and dies covered in shit” GRRM style of the earlier seasons. They’ve graduated from “gritty Vietnam war analogue” to “fantasy adventure heroes”Arya is an untouchable ninja Batman anime heroine that can defeat highly skilled, hulking, armored knights with her little dagger jutsu.Daenarys is a dragon riding princess revolutionary with an ethnically diverse army of loyal good hearted people… the rapey tendencies of the Dothraki have been ignored for now.Bronn is a goddamn super soldier of unlimited stamina and sure swordarm that will always be there for m’lord and can crank a siege weapon normally operated by a crew of burly men all by himself, firing it off with the speed and accuracy of a video game turret.Three-Eyed Raven has awoken to his Kwizatz Haderach powers, as the Bene Gesserits foretold.Jon is the hero prince of royal blooded prophecy come to unite the world against the cosmic evil force and is innocently incorruptable by dirty old man politics.Cersei is the dark lord with undead monsters that would’ve had her way if it wasn’t for the teenagers with attitude standing against her.That friendly fat guy has successfully lasted multiple seasons being a nice helpful person without getting raped and murdered by a wrinkly man, good for him as he does his science stuff and treats women with respect.For extra fun go back to the Season 1 Game of Thrones reviews praising the series for its gritty, everyone-can-die, not-your-typical-fantasy-heroism storytelling.We’ll see what kind of horrible fate awaits them in GRRM’s next book.
s07e04	It's easily the best episode in the season yet, and it's all because of that glorious battle we witness at the end of the episode. Said sequence being perhaps the most epic battle in the series so far.We start the episode with Jaime and the Lannister-Tarly army on their way back to King’s Landing, trying to hurry along with their spoils of war.Cut to Cersei and Tycho Nestoris, with the banker all but falling over himself to offer the Iron Bank’s services to Cersei. The Golden Company finds mention, and I'm certain we'll see them entering the scene in the next couple of episodes now that the Lannister-Tarly army is facing a severe burnout issue.The Starks are finally together in Winterfell. Arya gets herself in the castle with characteristic pluck and aplomb. Her reunion with Sansa is measured in sentimentality, as expected. Both of them realise that they've changed much since they last saw each other, but they're unsure about how much and in what ways.Sansa comes to realise it to some degree when Bran talks to Arya about her kill list and when Arya spars with Brienne. That scene was a real joy to watch. Brienne underestimates the tiny, fluid Arya when they begin. But Arya has learnt much from her dancing master and from the Faceless Men. Both of them end the match as equals, while Littlefinger watches on with his inscrutable face on, processing everything. But it seems Sansa got a bit too distressed to see her little sister changed to this degree.Speaking of change - it's a word that seems to be missing from the lexicon of Madame Targaryen. Getting Jon Snow on his knees (maybe in more than one sense) is all that's on her mind, despite Jon's elaborate exposition of the cave paintings depicting an alliance of the First Men and the Children of the Forest against the White Walkers. The show is definitely trying to build another incestuous angle here with Jon and Dany (since Dany is Jon's aunt if R+L=J). Jon also comes face to face with Theon after an eon with an expected dynamic.And now, coming to the pièce de résistance. Dothraki screamers and a Drogon-mounted, dracarys-mouthing Daenerys vs Jaime, Bronn, Dickon Tarly and the Lannister-Tarly army. Lord Tarly was conspicuous by his absence, even if we allow that he was likely at the front of the convoy than the rear. No prizes for guessing the outcome of the battle, but the entire sequence has been shot amazingly well.The sheer terror of the soldiers facing the Dothraki and Drogon the dragon; the horror of dead and alive charred bodies; the hopeless-yet-dogged resistance by Jaime as he tries in vain to hold off the screamers and the dragon - all of these were captured to brilliant effect.Bronn deserves a special mention here. We start the episode with him complaining about not being compensated adequately. We see him at the end of the episode as a man comprised almost entirely of guts and heart. Facing off a dragon in the face not once, but twice. And wounding him enough to ground him in the bargain. It remains to be seen if he survived the blast of napalm after bravely throwing Jaime out of the way, but I'm not too worried about it since he's one of the most popular characters on the show.All things considered, this is easily the best episode of the season. Can't wait for it to release on Monday so I can watch it again in glorious HD.
s07e04	MASSIVE PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD…To be frank, I debated whether I should answer this question at all today, or wait for Monday morning (here in India) after the episode’s official broadcast.In the end, because Quora is fundamentally a different forum than Reddit or YouTube, I decided to answer this question here. But, I do not offer any apology to anyone who feels that this question should not have been answered at all.AGAIN, MASSIVE SPOILERS FOR EPISODE 4, AHEAD. DO NOT BLAME ME IF YOU CHOOSE TO READ AFTER THE END OF THIS SENTENCE.So, with the disclaimers put in place, here’s my list.The episode opens exactly where I hoped it would, on the traveling Lannister army that is transporting the Tyrell gold to the capital. Bronn’s impetuosity is ridiculous and charming, since he, an upjumed sellsword, just tried to claim one of the most ancient castles in Westeros. Jaime shoots this down and throws in some shade, for good measure. This is a reference to the books, where Bronn has made himself Lord of Stokeworth.Tycho and Cersei’s conversation would have been riveting in an earlier season, now it’s just filler material. This conversation finally references the Golden Company, who I’m convinced will appear in season 8. Another wonderful nugget of information was that Qyburn is Cersei’s Hand (really?). Last week, it was Daenerys foreshadowing the Mad King by forbidding weapons in her presence (she continues to do this), and this week it’s Cersei, appointing a disagraced maester/necromancer as her Hand, as Aerys’s last Hand was the pyromancer Rossart.LF’s conversation with Bran is hilarious because it reveals to us that LF can’t even imagine something bigger than himself, like the Others or the dragons or Bran. And Bran is at that level now, no longer human, as is illustrated in his conversation with Meera. I don’t think we’ll see Meera again this season, though she probably will return will her people for the big fight, possibly along with her father Lord Howland, who knows about R+L=J.Arya’s arrival at Winterfell is completely in character, and yet who other than Sansa could lay claim to the title of Lady Stark when Arya asks which Lady Stark is currently in charge of Winterfell. I think this was a goof-up by the writers. That Arya and Sansa would meet in the crypts rather than in the courtyard was well done, and the show is trying hard not to show Lyanna’s tomb in this scene, which should be right next to Eddard’s.I noticed that Bran returned Arya’s hug and then gave Sansa a very meaningful look, which Sansa reciprocates. I think Sansa is trying to anchor Bran to his humanity and that effect gets stronger as more of the original six Stark children arrive. Bran recognizes that, and he tells Arya that he sees her all the time now, which means that she plays a big part in the war, since that is Bran’s primary concern. The dagger is then revealed, and gifted to Arya, and the three siblings are united in their distrust of LF. This is a framing device for the later manipulations of LF in trying to play Sansa against her siblings.That one scene of Arya wheeling Bran into the yard of Winterfell with Sansa following close behind, that nearly moved me to tears. On this show, you get so few moments where genuinely good things happen without anyone dying and this was a big one. To ruin it, we then see LF staring at the reunited siblings and just then, a raven starts cawing near him. This is a hint, that Bran is watching him while he’s watching them.Jon takes Daenerys on an interactive history trip and I don’t get why she’s so impressed with the obsidian. She knew it was there and didn’t give a hoot about it. The next bit though, it’s pure theory gold, a veritable motherlode for book theorists. The Children of the Forest and the First Men fought a battle against the Others at Dragonstone, or so it appears, but doesn’t that imply that wights can swim? They can, in the books, but on the show. Jon’s defense of the Wall is based on the assumption that wights can’t swim.Daenerys is given a shocking realization of how forces bigger than her at play, and dumbs it down to bend the knee and I’ll fight for you. That argument gives her no leverage over Jon, because the Others won’t stop after conquering the North. No, if none of the southron nobility help Jon, then he, the northerners and the Vale men fight and die, and their corpses will help the Others destroy the South.It’s utterly baffling to me that while Tyrion deservedly gets dressed down for his failures, Varys doesn’t catch any heat at all. Varys has failed in providing even basic information. By the way, I love how Tyrion’s we have a plan, it’s still a good plan sounds like a desperate salesman, and his pitch doesn’t work with Daenerys, who has decided to deus ex machina the war by burning the Red Keep itself. This is the show reminding us that Daenerys can go destroy Cersei whenever she wants to, and they are right.For all of his cleverness and talent with strategy, Tyrion hasn’t commanded through a war. Jon has been fighting and leading ever since he left Winterfell. So, it’s lovely to see Daenerys recognizing the things he’s achieved and ask him for advice. Jon’s words to Daenerys sound a lot like what Tyrion says all the time, but he puts in two specific references, namely melting castles as Aegon I did to Harren Hoare at Harrenhal, and burning cities, as Aemond did to the entire riverlands during the Dance of the Dragons. I think Tyrion and Jon convince Daenerys to attack the Lannister army a few miles outside of King’s Landing. This is a reference to the books, where Jon counsels Stannis, who wants to assault the heavily-fortified Dreadfort, to instead gather the allegiance of the northern nobility by retaking Deepwood Motte from the ironborn.Brienne is still beating Podrick blue (get it?) and frankly I’m worried he’s not learning anything, given how close the big war has come. Then Arya arrives, and we see the best sparring session since the one that led to the bastards are not allowed to hit princes joke. Sansa’s expression here looks a lot like jealousy and for all she’s endured and all she’s achieved, she probably feels like the underachiever, since one of her siblings is a resurrected King of Winter, one has mysterious fighting skills and the other one is a demigod. LF will prey on these feelings in the coming two episodes.Jon’s talk with Davos about Daenerys’s good heart had better be a red herring and I like how Missandei calmly outlines why she follows Daenerys. I completely approve of Jon’s enduring cynicism of Daenerys and it shows that he’s not letting his little head do his thinking for him. The confrontation with Theon was a bit of a let-down, but it had to be cut short, and for good reason.Now this part, to be honest, I thought this would happen in the next episode. I did predict that this would happen at the exact location it happens. Bronn laughing at Dickon’s name and the latter revealing his misgivings with betraying the Tyrells gives me hope that he will outlive his father. Bronn is somehow the first one to hear the cavalry charge, even before Jaime, who has likely participated in dozens of such battles over his very active military career.Before I get to the battle itself, here’s something that continues to bother me. The Tarly are a wealthy and powerful house in their own right, so why is it that even Lannister infantrymen have ornate plate armor while the Lord of Horn Hill and his son wear plain black plate that looks like it came out of a machine shop and was strapped on to their bodies straightaway. On a show that spends hundreds of millions on CGI, it is puzzling that such a basic, non-CGI mistake keeps getting made. At least put the huntsman of Tarly on their breastplates.Now to the battle itself. This was always going to be a rout. You put a tired and burdened infantry on an open field against a well-trained force of barbarians and the former will always get slaughtered. The history of the invasion of Attila the Hun is proof of that. Daenerys has a dragon, and if this one dragon can inflict so much death, then I wouldn’t be surprised if the nobility of Westeros started swimming to Dragonstone to see who would be first to reach her seat and bend the knee to her.How does Bronn survive everything? The man doesn’t wear any armor, and even though he jumps clear of the scorpion platform, there is no logical way he could have jumped far enough to avoid Drogon’s flames. Also, if lying down on the ground on your back is the way to avoid being roasted by a dragon, why isn’t it working for every other Lannister and Tarly soldier? I do enjoy Bronn as a character, I do, but this is not like defeating Vardis Egen, who was weighed down by Lysa’s stupidity, this is dodging dragonfire by lying down on the ground. Also, he’s able to correctly locate both Qyburn’s weapon, and then later, Jaime with pinpoint accuracy through the fog of war?Speaking of Jaime, I love that ‘why always me?’ expression when he hears Drogon’s screech right after he says we can hold them off to Bronn. Jaime’s crucial mistake is that he doesn’t account for Daenerys overruling Tyrion. Just as Tyrion errs by trying to fight Cersei without taking Jaime into consideration, Jaime’s fatal mistake to fight Tyrion without taking into account that Daenerys can always choose to overrule Tyrion. Anyway, it seems that she deliberately targets the convoys of supplies heading up to King’s Landing, something else I predicted. It also looks like the Dothraki have been specifically instructed to inflict as many casualties as possible, since they disregard the plunder in the wagons to kill as many soldiers as they can. Also, if Daenerys is in the fight, why aren’t her bloodriders leading the Dothraki on the field? And are they protecting Tyrion as his personal guard on the field of battle, or is he de facto their prisoner (tinfoil theory) after his many failures?Jaime’s regression into shit for honor person is complete, when his big courageous move to ride down an unarmed woman on the field of battle, She wields the greatest weapon of them all, though, and once again, even though Jaime is riding close to the shore, Bronn is able to find him, hit him with exactly the right amount of force at the right amount of time to throw them both safely out of the dragon’s line of fire and in deep water. Realistically, they should have hit waist-deep water and come up just to receive a second blast of Drogon’s fire. Since, Jaime and Bronn can’t die here, what happens instead that they get thrown into deep water, where Jaime, encumbered by the weight of his armor and his hand, begins to sink. I expect he will be rescued by the non-armor-wearing Bronn.I will conclude by discussing the minimal impact Qyburn’s scorpion bolt had on Drogon. All it did was startle him, since he hasn’t been hurt in combat since the fighting pit of Meereen, and make him angry. I don’t think he’s badly, or even significantly, hurt and will recover in a jiffy once the bolt is removed. If anything, the destruction of the Lannister-Tarly army and the loss of the Iron Bank’s gold along with Drogon’s injury scare (not to mention Daenerys nearly getting herself decapitated by one of those bolts) will put a bit of a pause on the war.
s07e04	It is the best episode of season 7 so far. Many huge things happend in this episode. Some reasons why it is so great:Arya returned to Winterfell. She is now becoming one of the greatest fighter we have ever seen in got. So far in the season we were not able to see any of her skills. She was just travelling. Now we get to see her insane abilities.Bran just owned Baelish in this episode with just one sentence which Baelish made to Varys a few seasons back: Chaos is a ladder.We are seeing something happening between Dany and Jon. I think this is leading upto an alliance made up by marriage which we heard in mereen in season 5.The biggest reason because of which this a great episode is the battle of dothraki and drogon vs the Lannisters army. We get see what we were waiting for almost 2 years: A full fleged fire breadthing dragon rode by Danaerys targeryen converting every bone and muscle of their enemy into ashes. Drogon is clearly the greatest dragon now in game of thrones surpassing Balerion the dread.But we saw why Jaime is still one of the most important character in game of thrones. He was leading an army against a certified death. He also thought of killing Dany and thought of ending the war. I think this is also an indication for him being the prince who was promised and who will end the war when the long night comes. Bronn also was very important in this episode. He was able to hit drogon with the “scorpion”.Overall this episode was what we were waiting for past one year. They were able to make battle which was I think the best. And also now we are seeing many characters leading upto something very important in coming episodes.
s07e04	A bit late to the party, but I’ll offer my two cents (very long answer approaching):First of all, it’s worth nothing that I am heavily biased toward the Targaryens in the final battle (I like the Starks the most, but Targaryen>Lannister), so take my answer as you will. Also, I pretty much agree with other posters as to the beginning of the episode, so I will focus on the final battle:GOT S7E4 Final Battle:I just don’t understand all the hate Dany is getting throughout this episode. Where do I begin? The first argument that people use against her is that she brought a bunch of Dothraki “savages” onto the shores of Westeros and used it to attack a Lannister army. What did you expect her to do? All her Westerosi allies were dead, the Dothraki and her dragons were all she had left, and she needed a victory somewhere to stop losing the war. Just because Dothraki are “mongols” and the Lannisters are “western Europeans,” just because the Dothraki have a “warlike culture” does not make the Dothraki more savage; when King’s Landing was sacked in Robert’s Rebellion, for example, Lannister soldiers raped, murdered, and looted everywhere. Every army has its fair share of rapers. Assuming Dany is unable to control the Dothraki and they loot everywhere, they are doing what any other army would have done.Lannister supporters also like to state that Daenerys burned so many “innocent men with families” during the battle. Pretty much any Westerosi army is comprised of decent men who are just following orders. When the Bolton men in the Battle of the Bastards were slaughtered by the combined Stark-Arryn-wilding force (end battle), I didn’t see anyone yelling “OMG y u kill innocent men dem Bolton families can’t survive without de men in the winter OMG shame shame.” The Stark men did what they had to do, if it meant killing people just following orders. Going back even further, Robb Stark’s men slaughtered Lannisters during the War of Five Kings, Lannister soldiers killed the Tullys, and going back even further to Robert’s Rebellion, the rebels killed “decent men following the Mad King’s orders,” and so on. Throughout GOT history, and indeed real life human history, armies have often been composed of decent men whose only crime was happening to live somewhere and therefore being forced into the army. Civilians have also been slaughtered in war. In WWII, 80 million were killed, most of them civilians and most others decent soldiers. You get it. War is hell. The only way to not kill innocent people in war is to not have war at all.I know there will be people who would say something like “Well, Dany used dragonfire to slaughter innocent men, bringing the uncalled for violence to another level.” Well, Dany used dragons against the ships in Slaver’s Bay, and I bet most of the men on those ships were people following orders, yet nobody cared. Most of Stannis’s army at the Blackwater was burned to death with wildfire (probably even more than Dany killed in the Field of Fire 2.0, since Stannis’s army was much bigger). How come nobody cried for them? The answer I can think of is that Bronn and Jaime were on the Lannister side this battle, and the audience has been introduced to some good Lannister men this season. Nevertheless, this doesn’t make the Lannister men any more unique than other men in other armies.Earlier this episode, Dickon even expressed regret at having killed some Tyrell troops he had known, to which Jaime answers that they didn’t deserve death but Lady Olenna chose the wrong side. Same here. Lannister troops were good, but their leaders chose the wrong side.I know some will say that Dany went complete overkill by using Drogon when Dothraki would have been enough. She simply used what was remaining at her disposal. She didn’t originally plan to use Dothraki and dragons, but she lost the rest of her troops. In battle, you want to ensure victory, if you truly need it. Dany was losing the war and needed an ensured victory. She used her dragons. Think of the dragons like the US Air Force: deadly, terrible if used wrongly (like if Dany burned King’s Landing), but not invincible (Bronn injured Drogon). You see the US military going into wars with aircraft carriers, tanks, artillery, aircraft, exponentially more technology than its opponents. Yet you see few, if anybody, say something like “That’s overkill! Cut the amount down!” When Europeans colonized the Americas, Africa, and Asia (like Dany invading Westeros), they didn’t hesitate to use superior weapons and technology to slaughter the opposition (of course there are exceptions).Isn’t this not fair? Of course it’s not fair. In war, if you find yourself in a fair fight, you’ve done something very, very wrong. That’s why people build castles in GOT, why they fight in advantageous terrain (Bloody Gate), why they equip their armies and train them the best possible. It’s so they can have an advantage. Like why would you willingly fight on even odds? 50/50 chance of losing? Are you stupid? It’s like playing Russian Roulette with 3 bullets in the barrel. You don’t have to have dragons to be equal, mind. When Jaime surprised the Tyrells at Highgarden, when the Arryns surprised the Boltons at Winterfell, it was not equal. When Stannis attacked King’s Landing with his huge force, it was overkill (not counting Joffrey’s wildfire), yet nobody called him out for it.Finally, people criticize Dany for burning the supply wagons. How could she have known there was food in the wagons? She may have thought they contained weapons, or gold. Even if she did know there was food in there, she couldn’t have attacked the Lannister soldiers without fear of friendly fire, and burning the wagons helped scare the Lannisters more and helped route them. Plus, the maybe 10 wagons she burned couldn’t have had all the Reach’s food.Some people don’t like how the Dothraki warrior said to Tyrion that “Your people can’t fight.” This was meant as a jest/taunt/insult, not an argument backed by evidence. If you take offence, then it’s working as intended.PS: I’m not a complete Dany supporter. I recognize she had her faults (give the Lannisters one more chance to surrender before the battle maybe, even if they had attacked Highgarden first). I also didn’t want Bronn and Jaime to die. I would have done the same as Bronn (shooting Drogon) and Jaime (trying to charge Dany in the end). However, I just don’t understand where the Dany hate comes from.
s07e04	SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!It was one hell of an episode . I did not want to watch the episode but as you all know Internet is dark and full of terrors I had to watch it .Some of the amazing higlights :• Littlefinger gave that valyrian steel dagger to Bran Stark and reminded him it was used in an attempt to kill him . Meera Reed left winterfell and was disappointed when Bran said ‘thank you’ at the end I think she was expecting a ‘I love you’ from him .•Dragonstone :Jon and Daenerys went to the beneath in seatch of Dragon glass and on the wall there were a lot of paintings carved depicting the First men , Children of the forest and the White Walkers . Daenerys felt amazed and told Jon that she will help him if he bends the knee .Then the news of Highgarden…and Dany got tensed and decided to take the matter in her own hands .•Winterfell :My most awaited moment….Arya back to the Winterfelk bitches…ohh yeah…and another Stark reunion …Sansa and Arya met in the crypts and now have a respect for each other . Arya met Bran in the weirdwood trees ..again emotionless and told he saw her at the crossings and gave her that valyrian steel dagger called Catspaw .Then Arya and Brienne got into a casual sworfight and Arya gave a tough fight to Brienne and she was damn surprised and asked who taught her and she replied ‘No one’ .Baelish and Sansa were watching her and they were surprised too…seems like this season is not for Baelish xD•Kings Landing :The Iron bank is having Cersei’s back as long as the gold keeps coming to them .•Highgarden :Randyll Tarly informed that gold is transported to KL and they were just moving away..then Dothrakis and Drogon took them with surprise and Lannister soldiers were actually shaking .Now I understand why Robert Baratheon said that only a fool would face Dothrakis in an open ground….they were too good and unstoppable with their weapons ..my favourite part was they standing on their horses , killing them with arrows and then jumping and killing them with their weapons..that was the best battle I’ve ever seen . First time I saw Bronn to be so tensed xD . Drogon set the field on fire . Bronn then used Qyburns’s machine and throw a arrow near Drogon’s neck and he nearly fall…Tyrion was also there and was terrified as hell but Drogon managed to control himself and Daenerys tried to pick that arrow and Jaime who saw his army getting roasted took a spear and was determined to throw that in Drogon’s eyes , Tyrion saying ‘fuck , don’t do it’ but at the last moment Drogon saw it and tried to burn Jaime but at the last second a man pushed Jaime into the water and we saw him drowned into the deep water and the epiosode was finished .One thing I notice is that Tyrion still care for Jaime .
s07e04	Ok, time for my weekly roundup of thoughts and grievances.In no particular order:#1: The Short GoodbyeI thought the Meera scene was really important. If nothing else, it explained why Bran went full homeschool.Going a layer deeper, Bran is also functioning in this scene as a stand-in for the gods of Westeros (and neighbouring lands). Why don’t they ever act in the ways we expect they should? Possibly because their loyalties are more expansive than ours. They see a bigger picture and care for different ends than we do with all our myopic personal struggles and vendettas.It’s hard to see yet if the remaining episodes are going to dive deeper into this angle or whether they’ll leave it for the books, but it’s an interesting thing to ponder. Each deity (even lesser ones like Bran and The Night King) seems to want something that’s rational to some unseen perspective.What might those be? And how would our feelings about the various character arcs change if we saw them from a wider point of view?#2: Live By the Dagger…As I touched on last week, the show has gone a bit foreshadowing crazy — but now to the point that they're really killing dramatic tension.As we learned in Episode 3, Littlefinger is considering some stunt using the archived raven scrolls of Winterfell.Bran will know what actually happened re: whatever narrative Littlefinger tries to spin, which he’ll tell his sisters.Arya likes killing people that screw with people she loves.Littlefinger’s sharp and shiny dagger is now in her belt.Sansa is already a wee bit tired of Littlefinger’s antics.Well, I wonder how that storyline will end?!#3: The Sound of One Trick ClappingBuilding on the same theme, I think we’ve reached peak callbacks. It’s a cool trick in moderation, but they need to staaaahp with the overkill.A non-exhaustive list I saw on Reddit from just this episode:The line between cable and network TV is supposed to be how the showrunners treat their audiences. I’d love them to aim a bit higher.The real downside here is that the more frequently echoes are used as plot devices, the narrower the list of possible plot outcomes becomes — which is a nuisance when we’re already struggling with excess foreshadowing and general plot armour.For example, thanks to Olenna, we know that Jaime has to get back to Cersei to have his confrontation with her (echoing his stand against Mad King Aerys). This really takes the punch out of using his sinking body as this week’s closing shot.#4: This Week in AwesomeBronn losing his gold reminded me of Jack Sparrow losing his rum in the best of ways. Also him gunning with that ballista thing (which I refuse to call by its supremely dumb show name) was pure 00’s action movie awesome.Tyrion watching the Lannisters get mowed down played well with Dickon mourning the deaths of his former Tyrell mates. These are good things. Seeing the fallen as our brothers is a big part of what causes a generation to finally reject war.This updated character bio…Drogon apparently never having learned how to dodge a wrench.Someone is trying to roast Jaime every episode (physically or metaphorically) and I love it.Arya’s “no one [taught me that]” was dope. Though it made me feel like it was yet another installment in the show’s tour of shedding B characters. If that was the final homage to the Faceless Men, I’m going to be lowkey disappointed. I guess we’ll get the real payoff from their storyline in the books.Theon showing a sign of life! Has any character ever taken us for a ride like he has? (Non-rhetorical question. I couldn’t think of any, but maybe I overlooked a few?)I loved seeing Dany go Moana on us. “GUYS, WE WEREN’T MEANT TO STAY ON THE ISLAND. JUST LOOK AT THESE CAVE DRAWINGS.” I’d pay ones of dollars for someone to make a montage of her ship scene from the end of last season with How Far I’ll Go in the background.#5: The Virtue of ThoughtfulnessI think how this show takes on stigmas and taboos is one of its subtle (too subtle?) strengths. It forces us to look at hard at things we generally only have shallow and/or reflexive opinions about in real life.Well, the Jonerys (Danno?) train is picking up speed as it heads towards Incest Station. That the two didn’t get there already in the cave was probably an intentional tease on the part of the showrunners. I guess they’re setting it up for this season’s finale (which allows the grand “yo, that’s your aunt” reveal and its aftermath to pop up in the final run).It reminded me of the episode of Community when Garrett and Stacy find out at their wedding reception that they’re actually cousins, with Chang making a speech about how that doesn’t make their love any less real. Given how prevalent cousin marriage still is in the world, that episode gave me pause and encouraged me to discard my “rednecks as backwater philistines” narrative — or to at least see it more dimensionally.That the show is clearly going there is interesting. It’s going to make us feel uncomfortable, but maybe that’s a good thing?PS - I seem to be in the minority on it, but I really loved the scene with Greyworm and Missandei a few weeks back. Both had never had ownership over their own bodies. Both had all kinds of negative self-images. That they could meet in an expression of trust and affection was amazing. I appreciate that the show takes time to explore those little human alleys, even when they aren’t core to the plot.#6: A Slow EducationAs I touched on last week, I think Danny’s gradual come-around to the evils latent in her “I am the rightful queen” narrative is the real spine of the show. Either she’ll end up as a benevolent ruler or her story will become the new reigning myth of power use by those who survive her.(Some have speculated that Sansa and Tyrion end up ruling at the end. The longer I thought about it, the more it seemed plausible. While Dany has had the longest path to enlightenment, you can kinda imagine her giving her life and the other two having twins named Jon and Danny to bring it all full circle.)Anyway, the current stage of her education revolves around that old saw about the danger of having a hammer as your sole tool (in that every problem begins resembling a nail). Well, when you only have dragons and Dothraki, you run the same essential risk.Based on the preview for next week, odds are on her using Drogon to roast her some unkneeling Tarlys (thus putting a fiery end to the worst Take Your Kid to Work Day ever). This stands to make things a bit awkward when Samwise comes back from Oldtown.When you combine her ambivalence about the dignity inherent in their loyalties (ditto Jon’s to his people) with her impulsive burning of the food wagons, you get the impression that she still doesn't really get it yet. She gets that she can’t burn cities with dragonfire, but has yet to see how her actions are still pushing the pendulum of reciprocal harm and violence.#7: The Golden Age of TVThat battle scene though! This is the third time the show has just crushed it. First we had the struggle for survival at Hardhome (i.e., Westeros’ Dunkirk), then we had the claustrophobia of the Battle of the Bastards, and now the futile terror of the Lannisters in the face of their childhood boogiemen come to life.With all due respect to other networks, HBO is making next-level TV both in terms of visual filmmaking and storytelling sophistication. When you look at episodes like this alongside entries like Westworld and The Wire, we’re seeing the medium perfected. I guess the next step must be virtual, as it’s hard to see how else you can get much better with current restraints.
s07e04	One of the best episode ending in a cliffhanger and shortest of the season so far.Cersei discusses further terms of engagement with Tycho . She mentions of Golden company which is one of the finest army of sell-swords having around 10000 men. It will be interesting to see if she is able to acquire their services. She also talks about recovering something which belongs to her.At winterfell, it seems that shitstorm is coming for Littlefinger. He gives the catspaw dagger to Bran and does what Litlefinger has always done to the Starks, manipulating them. The best part was when Bran mentions his famous quote ‘Chaos is a ladder’ and changes the looks on the face of Littlefinger. It seems that Bran must have seen something about what all Littlefinger has done to the Starks and the north.Then comes the farewell between Meera and Bran and its cold. Bran has reached the stage where he knows too much about the world to actually care about his sense of self.Atlast the moment I have been waiting for, Arya returns to winterfell and reunites with her siblings. The last two reunion between Starks for me hasn't been as heartwarming as the first one between Jon and Sansa. And now we know how the dagger ends up with Arya. There is still a mystery going around about who sent the cut-throat to murder Bran but I think it's largely clear that it was Joffrey.Brienne is happy that she has able to keep her vow to Catelyn. We finally see Arya in action with a sword going against Brienne and she is really good. Sansa seems surprised at what her sister can do and I think Littlefinger senses that he can work with something here. He must be planning to somehow neutralize Arya as he is unfamiliar with her and may perceive her threatening for his plans to take iron throne alongwith Sansa.At dragonstone we see the further development of bond between Jon and Daenaerys as they discover more about their history and how the children of the forest and the first men fought the whitewalkers during the long night. Daenaeys is still hell bent on Jon bending his knees and accepting her as the queen. I am happy that the show runners have not made it all easy between Jon and Daenaerys to accept each other easily. Daenaeys has grown respect for Jon which is evident when she asks for her advice on how to proceed in the war. It's good to see that she finally realizes that she is losing and still able to keep herself stable for now.On the other side Jon also appreciates Daenaerys as he learns about how she has helped slavers in the free cities.Theon arrives and receives a customary harsh welcome from Jon. It’s high time for Theon to earn back his respect and I think showrunners are moving towards that.There must be a reason why they have kept Yara alive and Theon maybe in future will go rescue Yara just like she tried to rescue him in the early season.And finally one of the best set-piece in the series where Jaimie’s forces are ambushed by the Dothraki and Drogon. It reminded me of the “Field of Fire” where Aegon during his conquest destroyed the armies of the reach and casterly rock with his dragons. Soon after that the tyrells who were the stewards pledge their loyalty to Aegon . Maybe after this , The tarlys will bend their knee to Daenaerys but the chances are low as most probably they are dead. Randall Tarly mentions that most of the gold has reached the Kings Landing, so this will make the fight more tougher for Daenaerys. Drogon spitting fire on the forces was spectacular and totally worth all the budget the show has been saving in last episode. The dothrakhi fighting and dominating the westerosi army will be headache for cersei. On the other hand , the scorpion though not able to kill drogon but still pierced his skin and made him to land. It can be improved and Daenaerys now knows that his dragons are not unkillable.One more important aspect was that Tyrion did felt sad for all the lannister men dying and seeing Jaime in danger . I believe in future he will still try to prevent any big conflict where Daenaerys has to use his dragons but still try to overthrow Cersei.All in all it was one of the best battles in the series and now we know that how much dangerous dragons are in the battle .
s07e04	Enter the Dragon!Drop your big Direwolf capes and duck for cover! Quickly! This episode is NUCLEAR!This is my recap for Game of Thrones, Season 7, Episode 4: “The Spoils of War”. So far arguably the best of the season. Ready- aim- SHOOT!Scene 1As Jaime takes Highgarden's gold to pay the realm's debt to the Iron Bank, Bronn (in the first lines of the season) complains he doesn't pay "his debt".Bronn wants his bloody castle already, yo!Will Bronn ever care for anything but money, I wonder..?.. (Wait for it…)Scene 2Tycho (AKA Mycroft from "Sherlock"), the delegate from the Iron Bank, is very impressed with Cersei, sell her a "new venture" and informs her the bank will suppprt her "as soon as the gold arrives".Scene 3Littlefinger gives Bran the infamous dagger an assassin attempted to kill Bran with eons ago in the first season + the one he held against Ned’s throat when he betrayed him, and the one that cut his mother Catelyn's throat at the Red Wedding (ahh, good times). Quite a thoughtful gift really…Baelish then goes on and on about his love for Cat, and how Bran got home only to find such chaos in the world. "Chaos is a ladder," Bran reminds him, and totally freaks him out.LIKE A BOSS! He might as well have said "BUSTED!". You know everything, Bran Stark.Astonished and alarmed, Petyr leaves.Meera comes over to part ways, shocked at how little gratitude Bran shows for her."Thank you?? That's all you have to say?? My brother died for you! Hodor and Summer died for you! I almost died for you!"(It’s like she’s reading fan-written opinions of Bran, who recieved anormous amount of hate after that horrifically depressing “Hold the Door” episode).It was poignant and gutwrenching.He replies: "I'm not Bran. Not anymore". She tears up in realization of what he became, "You died in that cave..." and I'm crying right now :,(Of course the most likely case is he died mentally to evolve, but I can't help but consider maybe Bran himself is actually dead and the previous Three-Eyed Raven is in his body..?? It's a little far-fetched I know, very unlikely and I like the philosophic option a lot better but still, a possibility.Honestly this is a better character development after last week’s out-of-nowhere tactless creepy behaviour.Scene 4You could cut the tension with a dagger, Arya, atop her horse, is riding with Winterfell is plain sight!!!This is actually happening, three Stark kids are getting back together- it feels too good to be true (which probably means something suicidally awful will happen very soon. Usually when stuff starts to look up ridiculously tragic catastrophes occur. So I'm waiting for the shit to hit the fan...There's a funny little bit where the guards don't believe Arya's who she is and tell her to "fuck off" (nice callback to Season 1 when the guards of the Red Keep wouldn’t let her in) and I worried she'd go Faceless on them or something xDWhen they let her in at last and argue who'll let her in, she looks around emptionally, and then when they turn she's gone. I was all but ready to smash the TV thinking she bolted until the next scene.Scene 5Sansa and Arya reunite in the Crypts and it is EVERYTHING! As father Eddard's statue watches over them, they catch up.When Arya mentions her kill list, Sansa giggles (you have NO IDEA, sister!). They talk about how unpleasant their long stories are, but Arya says: "our stories are not over yet". Sansa informs her Bran's home too.Scene 6At the Godswood, Arya and Sansa go to see Bran, and wow he's got a nice brand new wheelchair (finally!).His chair resembles paintings of a chair that Bran the Builder (the one who built the Wall) sat on, which reminds me of the theory that our Bran is actually several notable Bran's throughout history, with his time-twisting abilities.(Although this theory also means he must've banged several of his great-great-great-grandmothers (yikes!) and thus is his own ancestor? I dunno lol it's freaky stuff!)Arya’s puzzled when she hears of Littlefinger's presence in Winterfell, as Bran gives her his dagger.I could be wrong but I bet Arya slits Petyr's throat with that dagger (his own dagger, that is).Also she could use it on White Walkers when the time comes, since it is a Valyrian steel dagger.Scene 7Seeing three out of four Stark children home is something I never thought I'll see in a lifetime, and it makes me almost as satisfied as Brienne is right now.Petyr looks concerned as fuck though- as he bloody should be; your reign of chaos is coming to a probable violent end soon, Lord Baelish.I feel as though Littlefinger will meet his end in the next few weeks. Already he has various fronts to worry about:Arya could expose him for working with Tywin (that time in Harrenhal);Sansa could expose him murdering loony toon aunt Lysa and perpetrating the Purple Wedding (Joffrey's death);Maester Luwin's old scrolls could uncover some incriminating bombshell;The Hound (where is he anyway?) could spill the beans on betraying Poor Old Headless Dead Ned;And Bran.. Bran’s tripping! JK, he probably has a variety of Littlefinger’s crimes to pick which one to unravel.I recon he's finished. I genuinely believe it's no longer a matter of will he meet his end, but rather when and by whom.Unless he has one last genius trick up his sleeve... I admit it’s a bit too easy, so I hope he doesn’t go down without a fight!I can't help but notice a raven squeaking closeby- is Bran spying via ravens?Spy VS Spy!Scene 8There’s this short chat in which Missandei doesn't need to tell Dany what happened between her and Grey Worm because it's darn obvious (wink wink).I can think of no reason why this season highlights Missandei and Grey Worm, unless she’s a traitor and he’s a goner.Jon and Dany go dragonglass mining together, and I hope to all things holy this isn't their "first date" or something, ugh.Jon shows Dany drawings the Children of the Forest drew (and ladies and gentlemen am I aching for more of these awesome creatures!) to persuade her to join his cause; the way he holds her hand has me extra worried for the romcom angle.What is it with Jon Snow and damn caves..? Is he going to “bend the knee” here, probably causing Ygritte to roll over in her metaphorical grave? Luckily we don't see such a thing.Dany has me fooled: "I will fight for you. I will fight for the North"- AWW :D - "when you bend the knee". Seriously..? You're starting to sound like a broken record, Blondie."Isn't their survival more important than your pride?" she tells him, and the irony train blows Planetos up to ashes.Scene 9Tyrion fills Dany in with the lovely recent development in Casterly Rock and Highgarden, she is furious with him and practically blames him for it all.Dany reads my mind when she questions Tyrion’s ability to fight his own family. More on that later.So Dany seeks Jon's input, which turns out to be another stellar speech:"The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen. Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen. Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known. But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities... You're not different. You're just more of the same".Preach, baby, preach!I've got a forshadowy feeling about this, amigos...Scene 10Arya trains with Brienne, as Pod watches then aroused, and Sansa and Littlefinger watch from above. Sansa looks disgusted / disappointed. Littlefinger looks frightened.The Dance of the Beauty & the Beast is a very heartwarming / fun scene. Brienne asks "who taught you to do that?" and Arya hilariously answers "No One", smiling.Sansa is clearly troubled by what Bran and Arya have become. Is this what Littlefinger will use to mindfuck her?Scene 11Davos teases Jon about Dany ("I've noticed you staring at her good heart"), which further worries me about the possible impending Jonaerys doom.In a fun callback Davos corrects Jon when he says "less" and he says "fewer", and suddenly I miss Stannis the Manis (daughterslayer!).They meet Missandei, small talk and then see something in the ocean: one lone Greyjoy ship appears in the distant.Oh no.Is Jon Snow about to murder Theon Greyjoy?!If you don't recall, they were practically brothers growing up, before Theon betrayed Robb and the Starks and infamously took over Winterfell, billions of years ago.Among other heinous crimes, he murdered two small boys and burned them alive, which he then pretended were Bran and Rickon (there's a theory they were actually his biological sons, for he had several “encounters” with the Miller's wife back in the good old days...)"Sansa. Is she alright?" asks Theon, to which Jon replies: "What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you".That's fair.Theon informs everyone of Yara's predicament and asks for Dany's help rescuing her, but apparently she's already gone...Did she take the dragons out for a "walk"? Damn...!Scene 12The Reach looks awfully similiar to a Westworld set.Anyhow Randyll Tarly (Sam's father) rides over to Jaime and Bronn to inform of the gold's safe arrival at King's Landing (looks like the banker Tycho’s gonna be properly aroused next week).Jaime and Bronn ride to chat with "Rickon", Randyll's other son (actually Dickon, but Jaime always gets it wrong), and then brilliantly Bronn notices something wrong, and they see a large shadow... Oh my God it must be the dragon threeway!Furious chanting Dothrakis storm the scene and then, very Never-Ending-Story-like, Dany rides her dragon and says the magic word. A nice human barbeque ensues and OH MY GOD IS THIS IT FOR SER JAIME FUCKING LANNISTER?!If you don't recall, Jaime killed Mad King Aerys, Dany's father- which gave him the nickname "kingslayer". Is Dany finally getting her revenge on the Lannisters???Suddenly Jaime’s brilliant strategy taking The Reach horribly backfires and Dany finds a way to roast people alive without looking like a merciless pyromancer (after all the victims are soldiers, not civilians).Whatever helps you sleep at night, dragonlady. You don’t get any brownie points from me.This is it, my friends- the Field of Fire #2!As Tyrion watches from afar, you can really see pain in his eyes as he realizes the cruelty of the side he's fighting for- and the fact he is fighting against his own house, his own men and his own family. I swear if he and Jaime don't meet up..!I think if Tyrion wants to keep his heart of gold he should wise up about Dany's destructive potential, as should Jaime wise up about their deranged power-hungry sister Cersei.We get a nice little shot of Bronn choosing life over money (his bag of gold fell as he fell from his horse).He makes his literally bloody way to look for Qyborn's "Scorpion"- the secret deadly weapon against the dragons. I never would've guessed Bronn could actually be a dragonslayer.A stunning view of Dany riding Drogon almost touching a river preludes them zooming in on Jaime…Now is as good a time as any for Tyrion to choose between his politic aspirations and his humanity.But no, instead Dany approaches Bronn who aims and HITS DROGON!For a long, terrifying moment it seems as though Dany will fall to her death, but then the dragon stabilizes enough to "Dracarys" shit up again.Unrealistically, Bronn doesn't burn to death screaming.Jaime sees Dany taking the gigantic arrow out of Drogon's scales and seizes the opportunity to attack, while Tyrion gazes at them and mutter: "FLEE, YOU IDIOT!".As Dany sees him approaching Drogon opens his mouth and Jaime looks as good as dead- when somebody (presumably Bronn- or Dickon?) jumps over in the save of all times- maybe sacrificially so.He fall into the water and all goes up in flames.Jaime's armor slowly pulls him deeper into the watery abyss.THE END!…Episode Rating:ACTING 5EFFECTS 5PLOT 4ENJOYMENT 5ROUNDUP: 4.75…WOW!!!What an outstanding episode!After last week's mild disappointment I am glad to say the season switched gears. To be honest the season has been relatively slow by now, but I think the pace is quickening.The battle was super exciting. I didn't catch the trailer shot of Jaime riding through the fire though.Interestingly, the episode aired at the annual Hiroshima bombing anniverssary. A saddle hint..?Although I terribly miss Sam, the Hound, Tormund, Yara, Melisandre, even Euron and I still hold a candle for Gendry to come back- I think it's wise they didn't give us meaningless scenes just to pop up and say hi.The only ones I REALLY wish were to make appearance are our icy undead White Walkers.Yet again we face a situation where two characters we love (Dany VS Jaime / Bronn) battle to possible death, and we don't know what to think.Personally I'm team Stark, but although Cersei is the "big villain", I prefer Jaime over Dany any day of the week.I'm sensing a pattern of reunions and important characters crossing paths for the first time in huge quantities every episode.I guess they wanna get that out of the way in this season and perhaps next season we'll see the Dream Team march together to fight the White Walkers.I love that this season gives a decent amount of focus on Lannisters and shows them at their best, most competent selves. Hasn’t been like this ever since Tywin died really.I have to praise the performances of Nikolaj Coster-Waldo (Jaime), Jerome Flynn (Bronn), Peter Dinklage (Tyrion), Maisie Williams (Arya) and Ellie Kendrick (Meera); and the amazing effects, photography etc. used in the battle scene.Jaime and Tyrion are at their most basic humane cores. Bronn is at his most heroic and badass. Arya effortlessly owns every second and totally kills it with charisma, pathos and confidence. And Meera? She had her most saddening performance yet, and I’m sorry she’s gone.Is this the end of Jaime Lannister (+ Bronn, Randyll and “Rickon” Dickon Tarly, and perhaps the mighty Drogon)? Is it also the rebirth of a new Mad Queen- Daenerys?I can hardly wait to find out next week!(For the edited article on the site TellTales: Game of Thrones ‘The Spoils of War’ – A Visual Recap)
s06e01	★★★☆☆As far as season premieres go, this one was not so bad. It touched upon most, if not all of the cliffhangers that were left unanswered at the end of last year's season finale.Spoilers if you haven't watched Season 6 Episode 1. A significant portion of the episode - which I think was pretty short at only 45 minutes of runtime - was dedicated to the events at the Wall, which was not as chaotic as I thought at would be. We'll have to wait for next week for things to happen - for now, the Watch is reeling with the information that their Lord Commander is dead. Alliser appears to convince, except for a handful of people including Dolorous Edd, that Jon's death was a necessary one. While Edd goes to get the help of Tormund and the other wildlings, Davos and the last few loyal members of the Watch have locked themselves in a room with Ghost and Jon's body. I'm not sure what they are planning to achieve - with no notion of resurrection in their minds - perhaps, they are just trying to prevent the desecration of Jon's corpse, wanting to give him a proper funeral. Melisandre is shaken, possibly in a state where she's questioning her faith. Oh and, fan speculation that she's extremely old, glamouring herself to look young has been confirmed.Elsewhere in the north, Roose congratulates Ramsay on his victory against Stannis, but is not happy that Sansa had run away. We see Ramsay's tender moment, when he  remembers how he met Myranda - before he orders that her body be fed to his hounds. Classic Ramsay. Roose places a thinly veiled threat to Ramsay - if they don't get Sansa back, Ramsay is not likely to inherit the Bolton title. This is probably the only story arc that might end up in an unpredictable way. Between the Winterfell and the Wall, somewhere in the cold, Theon and Sansa are running, and even crossing a fairly wide stream doesn't help them escape Ramsay's hounds. But just as they were about to be captured and taken back to Winterfell, enter Brienne and Pod, who swear fealty to Sansa. It's highly likely that they will continue on to the Wall.In King's Landing, Cersei is overjoyed to hear about the return of her daughter, but that turned to ashes as Myrcella has died from Ellaria's poison. Surprisingly, she doesn't blame Jaime and rage at him, but is fully dejected, remembering the maegi's prophecy. We get a look at Margaery in her cell, seemingly not very far from confessing to her brother's "crimes". Down south, the ruination of Dorne is almost complete, as House Martell - which had ruled Dorne for thousands of years - is brought to an abrupt end with a very easy coup. All it took was two daggers, a spear and a completely indifferent Dornish guard. And for some reason I thought Trystane went to King's Landing with Myrcella. With Ellaria grabbing power, that Dorne will be ruled by "weak men" no longer, I suspect we'll get to see them declare for Dany when she comes to Westeros. I really hope we don't see them for a while though, I've had enough.Across the Narrow Sea, there is a short montage of the blind beggar girl being beaten with a staff, a look at Tyrion and Varys at Meereen, watching helplessly as their fleet is set aflame, and Dany's ring is very easily found by Jorah and Daario, with enough hoof prints around it to inform them that Dany is with the Dothraki. Another surprise is that it wasn't Jhaqo, like in the books, or even Pono who was one of Drogo's kos, who finds Daenerys, but the riders of one Khal Moro. There is a Moro in the books, who came to Drogo's wedding - apparently not in the show, for he doesn't recognize Dany at all. And here's where it gets convenient, he's quite possibly the most patient of khals, patiently listening to everything Dany has to say. And finally, with the realization that Dany is Drogo's widow, he promises her safety, and as expected she will be taken to Vaes Dothrak. Where did Drogon fly off to?And, that's it. There was nothing much in the episode for them to screw up, but they still managed to make a mess of Dorne. 7/10.
s06e01	★★☆☆☆Well, Game of Thrones is back, and guess what, the first episode was BORING. To be fair though, the first episode is hardly where interesting things happen. But it did cover a lot of cliffhangers from last season. Very gladly, the episode started with the cliffhanger of JonSnow. Dead Jon Snow. Well, we all know he can’t be dead. Never mind that they killed off Ned Stark, our first love, and thenRobb, and even that little twit Joffrey, Jon Snow just can’t be dead. And as book readers, may of us can tell with near certainty that he can’t be dead. Nope. But for the show, at the moment, he’s dead and the Night’s Watch has accepted it. It was a pleasant feeling to watch Ser Davos rouse up the support of the handful of good folks in the Night’s Watch(and Ghost) to what looks like a call to arms for the Wildlings. Dolorous Edd is now the sudden and willing leader here. The show just made it look a little too easy when Allister Thorne just blandly claimed responsibility for the killing and actually named others who co-conspired with him. Olly, the little boy, seems to be set up to be Joffrey v2. When he dies – and mark my words, he will die – it will be a source of great pleasure to very many of us.  And “easy” is just how I would describe everything that happened. Sansa escapes and bam! Deus ex machina Brienne turns up to help her just in time. (WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DOGS??) Dorne was easy too. Areo Hotah killed by a stab on the back by tiny Tyene?Just not digestible. While I thought Ellaria’s lip poison that killed Myrcella was a surprisingly clever idea, stabbing of Doran Martell while the guards watch was easy. It implies one of two things – either the guards were in on the idea and are connected with the Sand Snakes, or they’re too scared of them. Neither of the group mentality makes sense, just like how the brothers of the Night’s Watch simply accepting Allister Thorne’s “Oh yeah, I killed him now stfu,” without revolt. Same with Trystane Martell choosing who's to kill him, Nymeria or Obara, and predictably get cheated of it. It was a botched plot where the writers just wanted to make a dramatic point because, hopefully, we have more interesting things in the next few episodes. Dorne does raise a question, though. There’s has been a violent overthrow of a well-loved regime, a cold murder of a diplomatic alliance. Does this mean war? Cersei and Jaime have accepted Myrcella’s death and in fact are more emboldened than before. It’s hard to tell what Jaime is actually thinking (he is very different in the books at this point), but together, these two could be powerful. Dorne’s been simmering for a while, just waiting to blow up. My opinion is that there’s going to be a showdown between Cersei and Ellaria. I loved Ramsay Bolton. As ever, he was predictably unpredictable and despicable. As he grieved in his own way over Myranda’s body,I was mentally placing my money on him ordering someone to send the corpse up to his bedroom for the night, but throwing it to the dogs just made more sense. Roose threatens Ramsay by stating that if he doesn't bring Sansa back, he would legitimize his own future son instead. The Boltons don't get along and are held together only by their greed for power. It sure is going to be interesting to watch them turn on each other and crumble. Sansa’s transformation is making great progress! She’s grown from a stubborn little girl living in her own little fantasy world of princes and knights, to someone who’s dearest people are violently taken from her, to someone who lets the men in her life play her like a pawn because she’s unable to overcome her victimization, to finally someone who makes choices that dictate her course of life. Arya’s token scene didn’t tell much except for the fact that she’s still blind, but she’s soon going to become a deadly blind ninja. Margery's token scenes showed nothing either, except that she's still there, her love for her brother is greater than that for her baby husband, and that might probably never confess. Tyrion's token scene showed that he has a long way to go before he makes himself acceptable to the locals.Dany’s scenes were a tad predictable, except for the Dothraki humor which brought a refreshing change to the otherwise fearless-warrior image that the people have. A Khal not touching another Khal’s widow was another easy plot point that made the savage Dothraki seem suddenly human, but Dany is going to be escorted to Vaes Dothrak, the land of the widows. Come on, Drogon! Bran is still missing. He was gone all of last season and wasn’t there in the first episode. We can only hope that his powers have grown tremendously and he has graduated a fair bit from warging into Summer and Hodor alone. Warging raises a lot of questions. Can you warg into other humans? Into any other living being? What about inanimate objects? And how far away should someone be for Bran to warg into them? Could he warg into Ghost at CastleBlack? (That wasn’t a spoiler from the books btw, the show has progressed beyond the books at Castle Black). Melisandre.. well, we all knew she was old. Now we know how old she really is. The reduction of this incredibly powerful woman to someone so aged, slow, weak, nearly withering away, and human, was an unexpected end to an otherwise ordinary  2/5  episode.Takeaways from this episode and what I expect this season:1. Revolt in the Night’s Watch.2. War waiting to break out between King’s Landing and Dorne.3. More empowerment to women: Sansa, Brienne, Cersei, Ellaria, Sand Snakes, Arya, Dany, and the suddenly frail Melisandre.  4. The dragons are coming.
s06e01	1- 10, I'd give it an 8. This season premiere was good.It started where the last episode from Season 5 left off.  The title was interesting, I thought the Red Woman would do something extraordinary or they'd show who she truly is and the show did, though I didn't expect in that way. Cersei was happy when told that Jaime is back because she thought she'd see Myrcella but her smile disappeared as quickly when she realized she's dead. Dorne is a mess. :D I guess they're really doing their own version of Dorne events, I hope it will make sense though but they're intelligent people so maybe they'll pull it off. One of my favorite parts of the episode was Sansa and Theon's escape because REEK was wonderful. Spoilers Wall - Having Davos in there helped to delay the chaos, I think. It would've been bloody if he was not there because Jon's friends and others loyal to him were willing to kill without having a plan. So no more killing happened, for the meantime. Some of loyals stayed inside the room while one of them will gather other men who are loyal to Jon Snow, I think they'll call upon the wildlings to fight with them. Sansa and Theon (FAVORITE) -  Reek leading the way and trying his best to save Sansa was wonderful to watch. He was really brave right there. Sansa's learning *happy dance*. Those lines she said when she was accepting Brienne swore fealty..goosebumps. Dorne - Didn't expect things would be like but yeah, interesting how things will turn out. Arya - was briefly showed and she's training to use her senses. One training sesh and she's done. No other arya scenes. I didn't expect much airtime for her, anyway. King's Landing - Cersei was sad and realized the prophecy's coming true. A good foreshadowing about Tommen's fate. I think she was sad that Myrcella's dead and fearful at the same time because..prophecy. I'm looking forward to many things for Jaime this season. I wanted to see the change of heart towards Cersei. Meereen - It was nice to see Tyrion and Varys. I think they just automatically took in the responsibility of taking care of the city since Dany flew off. And man, they're in a helpless situation..again. Daenerys - Good thing Dany was found by Khal Moro. He seems less barbaric. LOLed when Dany said her titles because God, she never learns. It seems that she's being driven deeper and deeper into the Dothraki culture. I wonder how she'd take all these things..a training to be a Queen of Westeros or a wake up call that this is where she belongs? Up to her.The Red Woman - This one's bit interesting and now I'll review other episodes where the red woman was present. I'll check what is up with her. That ending was interesting. And it shows the connection of the Lord of Light, Jon Snow, and the Azor Ahai. I think it's possible that the red woman will sacrifice herself to bring back Jon Snow. All in all, it was a good premiere. It set what we will see and can expect from this season. So, I will wait for that Dorne plot to unravel and see what this season have in store for us. It's still episode 1 after all. I truly love the Sansa part. I think Sansa scenes would be one of the best things we will see this season. Looking forward to BRAN, Tower of Joy, and Iron Islands scenes. Of course, Jon Snow. :) 
s06e01	The Day has finally arrived.The Day when book readers no longer have the smug superiority of knowing what happens.The Day where we officially have no basis to say whether the book or show is better.The Day where we have to address all the problems GRRM created in book five.Crap.SPOILERS AHEADFor the record, I've read all of GRRM's books, so watching this episode felt very strange to me. It's kind of exhilarating not knowing what happens, and I look forward to some real suspense this season.On the other hand, well. We'll get to that.Let's start with the things I liked:The Stark girls continue to be a highlight. I'm so glad we've finally gotten to blind Arya, and I hope the Faceless Man plotline speeds up. And yay, Sansa is finally away from Ramsay and maybe can actually become her own woman now, you know, with more agency and less rape. I was so glad to see her reunite with Brienne and accept Brienne's service.Tyrion in Meereen with Varys is wonderful. Just wonderful. I could do an entire show of this. I love seeing Tyrion back in charge, and having Varys there with him is a great change from the books that allows the two of them to play off each other.Seeing Dany back among the Dothraki is also a wonderful change of pace. She was a much better Khaleesi than a Queen of Meereen, and seeing her shock the Khal and his wives with her knowledge of Dothraki and her position was a highlight of the episode - as was seeing her shock and anger when they told her she was going to Vaes Dothrak (as we all guessed).I'm a fan of the Jorah/Daario buddy cop show, even if they found Dany's ring way too easily.And now the not-so-great:Dorne. WHAT THE HELL. Dorne was bad enough last season, with all the characters turned into caricatures of their book-selves and the death of Myrcella. My desire to shoot the Sand Snakes hasn't changed, which is unfortunate because I really liked them in the books. And it was PAINFUL to watch Doran and Areo Hotah die. The two of them are wonderful and nuanced in the books, and their undignified deaths in the show were just the shit icing on a shitty Dornish cake.Me, watching the Dornish scenesGet Jaime away from Cersei already. Jaime's arc was the main reason I liked Feast for Crows - I loved that he had finally realized what a horrible person he had been and what a horrible person his sister still was. I really want Show!Jaime to get with the program here.My soul cries for lack of Petyr Baelish. I simply MUST know what shenanigans he's up to.And in the category of things I don't know how to react to - that last scene. On the one hand, it was a nice reveal that Melisandre is not as she appears and that she has more power than one might guess. On the other hand...I did NOT need to see that. A shoulders-up reveal would have been fine. Really. I promise.Overall though, this was a solid start to the season. I'd give it a seven out of ten.Unanswered QuestionsIS JON SNOW DEAD FOR REALSIES AND FOREVER AGHGHGHGHGH?Seriously though, where is Baelish?What was Drogon doing while Dany was captured?How are they going to reintroduce characters that have been off the show for over a season?
s06e01	I was excited to finally see a new episode of Game of Thrones, and it definitely didn't let me down. The episode told us everything we needed to know for the new season, establishing exactly where everyone was and setting up new storylines. Some parts were a bit disappointing (*cough* - Dorne - *cough*), but overall, it was an enjoyable episode.Spoilers below if you haven't seen the episode yet!So we start where we left off at the end of Season 5. Ser Davos finds Jon Snow, who is still quite dead. He secures his body and convenes with Dolorous Edd and some other friends of Jon's about what the heck they should do now. Edd is ready to make a stand and sacrifice their lives to get back at Thorne, but Davos has a better plan. Go get the Wildlings, Edd. They should be more than happy to avenge the man who saved them from extinction.Meanwhile, Alliser Thorne establishes his own command with a rousing speech about how it was absolutely necessary to betray Jon in order to save the Night's Watch. I actually quite liked this scene, because it establishes Thorne as a man who does anything for the things he believes in, rather than a vindictive bastard. I can actually see where he's coming from, even if I still want him to die a painful death.In Winterfell, Ramsay has some own mourning to do as he grieves over the loss of Myranda. We see a tiny sparkle of humanity here, until he orders the maester to just feed her body to the dogs. But trouble arrives with Daddy Bolton chastising him for toying with Theon and Sansa, because now they're both gone. And by the way: if Ramsay doesn't find Sansa, he's quickly making himself useless and disposable, especially if Mother Bolton gives birth to a real heir to the North. Whoops indeed.Theon and Sansa are fleeing for their lives, which is quickly taking a toll on poor Sansa. Theon tries to hide her and face the Bolton soldiers himself, but they quickly discard him and pull Sansa out of the bushes. But just when you think everything is lost, Brienne and Pod rush to their aid, completely saving the day. Yes, I know... what a coincidence! But I'll let it pass, because it was absolutely awesome and I love how Sansa has finally found an aid who can actually help her and who is completely loyal to her.Back in King's Landing, Cersei is looking forward to a happy reunion with her daughter Myrcella. But as the witch Maggy the Frog already predicted, her joy will turn to ash in her mouth, as gold is the shroud that covers Myrcella's dead body. Cersei is just about ready to admit defeat to the inevitability of prophecy, but Jaime is still ready to fight. They're the only ones who matter, so f*** prophecy, right? It's a strong moment, but Jaime keeps changing his mind about who to support. Sometimes he's on Cersei's side, sometimes he's working against her. Weird.And yes, Margaery is still in jail, but that scene is boring so I'm going to skip it. Let's move on to Dorne, because oh boy, do I have a Dornish bone to pick!Prince Doran gets the news of Myrcella's sudden and unexpected demise. And right at that moment, all hell breaks lose. Tyene Sand quickly disposes of Areo Hotah, as her mother puts a dagger into Prince Doran.Okay, stop! Isn't Doran supposed to be this genius ruler, who came up with the whole Dornish Masterplan that spans decades? How did he not see this coming? Why are those Sand Snakes still allowed to sneak around Doran, after they got thrown into the dungeon for trying to kill Myrcella in the palace gardens? Do you not have whisperers of your own, Doran? As you say: "We each have our roles." But it looks like your role is just to be absolutely USELESS!Jorah and Daario are still looking for Daenerys. So that's a scene.Daenerys finds herself in a familiar place as a captive of the Dothraki. When she's taken to the Khal, she first tries to impress everyone by saying how she's Daenerys Stormborn, Bearer of Many Titles. But in the end, she does manage to turn some heads when she mentions that she's Khal Drogo's widow. That helps to avoid her getting raped, but that does bring up a new problem. Because all Dothraki widows are supposed to return to Vaes Dothrak to join the dosh khaleen. Yeah, that's kind of a bummer if you plan to take over the world...Arya is back in a familiar place as well: begging on the streets with no one to care two cents about her (literally). She's now blind, after trying to use a forbidden face to kill Meryn Trant. And what's worse: she gets beaten up by that Faceless Man who looks like a girl, who tells her this is what she can expect every day from now on, so maybe it's about time to do something about it!We end the episode back at the Wall, where Davos and his friends are getting ready to fight. Things look pretty grim, but Davos still puts his faith in the Red Woman who may be able to turn things around. Melissandre herself is getting ready for bed and takes off all her clothes. Suddenly we see what she really looks like. And yeah... I can see why you've decided to dress up as Carice van Houten, because you're not exactly Miss Westeros, are you?And so ends the first episode of a new season. It was satisfying to see all familiar faces return to move the story forward. Some scenes were quite boring and didn't really drive the story forward, and the Dornish plot just needs to go away because it's stupid and useless. But all other plots are still great, so I'm a happy Throner :).This time, there's no clear direction from the books, so the showrunners have to lead the way for the story to unfold. But based on what I've seen in this episode, I'm confident they'll pull it off. See you next time!
s07e05	Previously in Season Seven of ‘Game of Thrones’…Brought to you through the medium of TV TropesOne of the big mysteries in ASOIAF is whether the Others bring the cold, or whether the cold brings the Others.In the show, it’s clear why Winter Is Coming…… the amount of Fridge Logic has increased somewhat exponentially.‘Fridge Logic has been the writer's-room term for these little Internal Consistency issues for a good while, as in "Don't sweat the Fridge Logic, we've got bigger fish to fry. We've only got 20 minutes left to work in three costume changes, a foreign language, and a weird wig." It refers to some illogical or implausible plot point that the audience doesn't realize during the show, but only long afterwards. This naming is highly subjective, since not every person follows the same train of thought. Some people will never even realise there was a problem, while others will call it a Plot Hole, since they already noticed the problem during the show’ - Fridge Logic - TV TropesFridge Logic in the show had mainly been contained in Dorne and Meereen prior to Season Seven. Imagine how baffling Dorne would have been had the climate been less clement.Season Seven, Episode Five…Post-Drogon TraumaCersei’s icy breath in the Season Seven trailer is a direct result of Jaime and Bronn’s survival turning the Fridge Logic up to 11.Sam doesn’t need to worry about his father’s disapproval any more.Dany makes the world a better place ( - apparently) by burning Dickon.Dragonstone… in which Varys realises he might have a serious case of the Stupid Goods.It literally doesn’t not seem to have occurred to him that Dany’s dragons might burn a bunch of people alive - not in battle - and not because Dany herself has singled them out to Teach Them A Lesson.One thing’s for damn sure - the Tarlys won’t make the same mistake twice.Varys and Tyrion ( - who’s not quite a Stupid Good because he does want a handful of people die screaming) were perhaps under the impression that they might rock up with the dragons and their mother, and the entire population of Westeros would be all like, Dragons, cool - you should totally be Queen.Jorah #sadface Mormont resurfaces just in time to be noble and leave for Eastwatch with Jon et al . They are on a fact-finding mission to collect a dead thing and bring it back as proof. Why not?King’s LandingIf there were two things I thought I could rely on they would be:i) Davos is Just A Simple Man,and ii) Davos is great at smuggling.Cancel ii).Davos is terrible at smuggling.^^^ That is not a smugglers cove. Not even slightly.Smugglers coves are not known for their high visibility. Davos doesn’t even try to skulk, nor does Tyrion - they are a WANTED poster, personified.Westeros is at war, and he and Tyrion are on the side that’s just roasted thousands of Lannister soldiers and they are showing their faces.On a beach that can be seen for miles - and where Davos brings bribes because he knows that the Goldcloaks patrol the beach - as if it were Baywatch, but rubbish and bribe-able.Side note: it is unlikely that anybody would ever find out whether fermented crabs improve virility. In both the real and fictional worlds, eating fermented crabs is a cast-iron guarantee of not getting far enough to find out. Davos owes Gendry big time for war hammering those two Goldcloaks before they got a chance to sue him for false advertising.Jaime and Cersei‘Cersei is a lying whore, she's been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and probably Moon Boy for all I know’ - Tyrion, A Storm of SwordsJaime: Am I the father?Cersei: Yes.Oh dear me.… in the CitadelThe Maesters are arguing over Brexit, but Sam is too busy ranting to notice the pay-off from his home-schooling of Gilly in Chekhov’s Skill.Extra points for the musical score accompanying Sam in the library, as he steals all the books about Horcruxes. It has its own theme.In WinterfellBranOne benefit of Bran’s wireless access to the weirwoodwideweb is that he can be a normal teenager and play Angry Birds from the comfort of his own home.Since his return from the Hidden Elf Village, he’s had a lot on his mind, like the whole of Time and Space. He catapults the Angry Ravens with his brain, but unfortunately fails to Scam Cthulhu.However, if the Night’s King can detect Bran Beyond the Wall and catapult his consciousness out of the Angry Birds, then logically it follows that, if Bran gets stronger, he might be able to catapult the Night’s King out of the Wights.Maybe Bran should try Squirrel Surveillance next time:The Tale of Littlefinger Who Has Not Been Murdered.Littlefinger started off as a Magnificent Bastard, but he’s rapidly degraded to a Smug Snake that makes no sense.Robin Arryn has still not returned from being Put On A Bus plotwise, unlike Gendry who’s been allowed out for a comfort break, before reboarding.Robin Arryn - who implausibly stands between Littlefinger and his death - has been on that bus for so long, without any adult supervision, that, if he does reappear they’ll be three of him at once.Side note: the Dothraki - all 100,000 of them must sympathesise - having been Put On A Bus for two episodes along with all their horses, beards, and pointy, pointy arakhs before, finally, getting a bit of fresh air on a battlefield thick with choking death smoke, fire and arakh fodder.Littlefinger had a royal flush for five seasons before setting fire to his cards, because that’s what the cleverest, most cunning man in the Whole of Westeros does. His fig leaf of ‘I’ll tell that whiny kid and his falcon’ or ‘I’ll tell that Cersei who you’re already rebelling against’ is slipping, which perhaps explains the Ominous Opera Cape .^^^ like that, but Lurkier.One last hurrah for Lurkfinger, as he out-lurks Arya - who goes from Faceless Man Super Ninja Assassin to Little Girl in even less time than Varys can travel to Dorne, or Euron build himself an unaccountably ornate fleet of exactly one thousand boats.This is why you shouldn’t walk out half way through being trained.A Faceless Man would taken the face of Maester Vulcan - or whatever he’s called - and gone straight to source, rather than being set up by Is-This-The-Secret-Thing-With-No-Copies-That-I-Will-Make-A-Half-Arsed-Effort-To-Hide.EastwatchI can’t lie - I am very concerned about Tormund.He needs feeding up - if this wasn’t fictional, I’d go up there and make him a proper dinner with roast potatoes and Yorkshire puddings.Now Jon’s arrived - and he has Important Characters in his dungeon - we have all the players required, ready to become Fire Forged Friends.Next week they’ll be Back to Back Badasses.The Brotherhood without Banners, featuring The HoundThe Hound is going to have to re-calibrate his sarcasm Beyond the Wall.The Others and the Wights are literally shit at dying.It’s going to be a Huge Problem. Believe me.The Hound is right on schedule for a Why Did It Have to be Snakes .Meanwhile Beric is heading for a By The Power of Grayskull - and not the for the first time. He had one in Season Three - he had it in the books - this is literally Blood for Fire and Fire for Blood.I’m going to predict that it’s Melisandre that gets a sword through her heart to forge Lightbringer in the show. And that it will be Dany in the books.Side note: It is no wonder that R’hllor never took off in Westeros. His priests are rubbish. They are sulky (Melisandre), or drunk (Thoros), or ‘probably resembles Yoda on a bad day underneath the glamour’ (Kinvara).When 900 years you reach, look this good, you will not.The Lord of Light needs to up his game.That’s your lot.Looking forward to next week:^^^ This guy - I like his style.
s07e05	NOTE: Anyone trying to insert bullshit edits-that-aren’t-actually-edits into this (or anything else I write) is immediately getting blocked. I’m done fucking with it and if you don’t already know that this is a garbage thing to do, I have no interest in engaging with you, ever. (If you have an actual edit, like a typo or grammar mistake or factual error/clarification, please proceed.)*cracks knuckles* Let’s go.Jaime’s alive, as we all pretty much knew he had to be. I have no idea of the logistics of Bronn dragging an armored guy whom we last saw sinking quickly to the shore of this … lake … thing, but OK. Bronn, being Bronn, tells Jaime that Jaime can’t die until Bronn gets paid. Jaime’s understandably dazed at the prospect of fighting multiple dragons.Tyrion gets to walk through ashes to a melancholy version of “Rains of Castamere.” Dany has some of the survivors around her and gives the spiel about not being there to murder anyone, leave the world better than she found it, blah blah. Does anyone actually believe this? It’s one thing to say, “I won, you lost, might makes right.” But having just massacred hundreds of people, I’m not sure someone gets to give the “great liberator” spiel.The Tarlys get burned alive. I give the show credit for not having Randyll make some sexist/rape quip before dying. His rationale is a fair one, and you also respect Dickon for going with his father. Tyrion is troubled by the whole thing. The soldiers kneel to Dany because they’re scared shitless of her dragon, and for no other reason. The Tarlys probably fall just far enough along the asshole spectrum for casual viewers to cheer on what Dany is doing.Jaime tries to talk sense into Cersei. Cersei’s nuts, but … she’s not wrong here. Dany has no reason to make offers. I am surprised that Jaime actually told Cersei the truth about Olenna; I thought he’d keep it to himself. I’m sure Cersei still hates Tyrion, for obvious reasons, but this might be a small source of a ceasefire between the two of them in the future.Dany returns to Dragonstone on Drogon. Jon stands his ground against the dragons and pets him. I know everyone will be all, “It’s because Jon’s a Targaryen!” But a bonded dragon is in tune with the feelings of its rider. Meaning, Drogon and Dany have a connection going on, and Drogon tolerating Jon or showing Jon any sort of ease is probably more about Dany’s opinion of Jon than Jon being a Targaryen. (If it were one of the unbonded dragons, you might be able to argue the Targaryen thing. But that’s probably not what this is.)Interestingly, Jon is left unaware of the specifics of what Dany did to the Tarlys. I have to wonder if it matters at all or if it’s an important point that he just doesn’t seem to know. Jon would understand the whole “rule from a position of strength” thing. “Burning prisoners alive,” though, not so much.Jorah’s back just in time to be friendzoned again. Dany takes him back into her service and it’s like he never left. And again I have to wonder why they gave Jorah greyscale if he was going to be so easily cured. Was it important that he was absent during Dany’s early blunders? Was it to give Sam something to do? Was it to lay the groundwork for Sam realizing he inadvertently helped the woman who killed his family? It could get either very complex or very stupid, plausibly, in either direction.Bran wargs an entire murder of crows. (Ravens? Crows? Whatever. Is it still a murder if it’s ravens? EDIT: An unkindness of ravens, thanks) He sees the Night King’s army on the march and the Night King seems able to “throw” Bran out of the birds, which is interesting. Poor Maester Wolkan has to write scrolls to everywhere telling everyone about what the crippled kid saw through the eyes of a bunch of birds.Sam’s doing bitchwork at the Citadel still. The maesters are skeptical of Bran’s story and Sam tries to vouch for the story. Sam gets frustrated when the maesters don’t take the threat seriously, especially because the maesters are one of the few groups with the authority to tell people what to do. We get a nice Jenny of Oldstones Easter egg. The sequence ends with us learning that Sam doesn’t know what happened to Randyll and Dickon.Varys and Tyrion are talking about Dany and even Varys is drinking. We get a taste of what life was like under Aerys, and Varys seems to think Dany can avoid becoming Aerys if Tyrion gets her to listen. Here’s the thing: We’re getting to the point of “put up, or shut up” with Dany and her … proclivities. At some point, this has to matter. There needs to be a payoff with this kind of talk and with the Tarlys and everything else. If absolutely nothing comes of this, why bother? If Dany is so great, why is she doing this? When Tyrion and Varys are talking about it, in-story, you can’t just wave it off as anti-Dany bias. We’re meant to see that people in-story are troubled by what she’s doing. So where is it going?I liked Jon a lot this episode. He’s been a little bland this season so far, but you get a spark of Jon when he tells Dany (who after all this is still talking like she can keep him there against his will) he can go whenever he damn well pleases.The group works up a plan to have Jon and Co. bring a wight back from beyond the Wall to prove to Cersei and everyone that the threat is real. This sets up the season’s set-piece episode next week. Jorah volunteers to go, and so does Jon.Winterfell. Sansa’s holding off the restless lords who are starting to regret naming Jon their king. Arya watches the proceedings. Sansa and Arya have a nice scene in Sansa’s room (Ned and Catelyn’s old room). You finally get a sense of how brute-force Arya’s become (just behead them!) and Sansa has to talk sense into her. Arya’s right that the men shouldn’t be insulting Jon, but Sansa’s also right about keeping her coalition together. Arya accuses Sansa of wanting Jon to not come back so she can be Queen in the North. The Stark sisters’ animosity is troubling; I hope these kids work it out.Davos smuggles Tyrion into King’s Landing. Bronn lures Jaime to the dungeons where Tyrion is waiting. Tyrion gives a bit of a sob story before Jaime tells him to shut the fuck up, mercifully. Tyrion gives Jaime the terms and Jaime has to take them to Cersei.Davos turns up Gendry, who has a nice warhammer now, like Robert. I know we all wanted Gendry to come back, we were expecting it, but can we just admit that it feels a little convoluted that Davos happens to get back to King’s Landing (what if Tyrion hadn’t needed to go?) and happens to find Gendry who happens to be ready to go, man! I’m happy he’s back, but … yeah. They pushed the Staples easy button there. Gendry bashes some Lannister soldiers’ heads in with his hammer, and Tyrion’s a fan!Jaime comes in to tell Cersei the terms and Cersei immediately tries to see how they can benefit from it through a double-cross, after telling Jaime she knew about the Tyrion meeting and let it happen. Then we find out Cersei is pregnant and … you know what, fuck it, I’m kind of … happy for them? You know the kid is doomed (three kids, remember!), but … it’s bizarrely touching.This is probably the biggest under-the-radar moment of the episode and I bet at least half the viewership missed it. Sam’s frustrated with the maesters and Gilly’s showing off her reading skills. We find out that a High Septon Maynard granted an annulment to a Prince “Ragger,” and then conducted a secret wedding ceremony in Dorne. Sam barrels through with his ranting against the maesters. But basically we just got confirmation that Rhaegar had an annulment from Elia Martell, he married Lyanna Stark in Dorne, and Jon is not a bastard. I have been arguing this for goddamn years, so you’ll forgive me a short moment of fist-pumping. (I’d always guessed it was polygamy, and it might yet be in the books; it’s possible the show used an annulment because it was easier to explain. Either way, go me.)The stupid editor cut off the last part of my review when the question was merged and I lost it. I’m too tired to write it all over again but: The Arya-Littlefinger-Sansa stuff has to be resolved this season; I liked Jon and Gendry’s meeting; Tormund was hilarious and “The one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother?” “Both” was amazing; the issue with Dany’s violence and Varys and Tyrion being concerned about it has to come to a head at some point; this was a nice episode for a set-up piece even if parts of it were pretty overly convenient.I need to remember to type the review outside of Quora so I don’t lose it, from now on. Annoying as shit.
s07e05	I enjoyed this episode for the simple fact it brought back a number of likeable characters and actually put them all on a quest together. The magnificent seven rides again. Only thing better would be if they included Brienne, but I think her ultimate role is going to be socking Littlefinger in the gip.I think the most entertaining thing in the episode was watching Gendry meet Jon.Didn’t like Dany burning up the Tarlys. I understand why she did it but it was a bit draconian, especially killing Dickon. People gave me crap about calling Edmure a coward (which he WAS), but at least Dickon and Lord Tarly went out like knights are supposed to.I’m not really buying Dany’s argument that Cersei is the real enemy when she’s BBQing enemy prisoners when they don’t accept her. She’s becoming more and more a chip off the ol block and that’s why Jon is the true King. Looks like they are setting up Jon to ride a dragon. Probably the white one.Speaking of Jon, A bunch of people were proven wrong since they confirmed that Rhaegar actually married Lyanna which is what I always figured. (I thought he had two wives like Aegon the Conqueror though) I bet that Robert probably even knew it too because Lyanna seems like the type that would tell him and Robert’s Rebellion was partially spawned out of spite.Bronn as usual is one of the only people acting like a person would really act. “Dragons? That’s where our partnership ends. I’m outta here. Good luck.”I also didn’t like the scene between Jaime and Tyrion. It was a bit forced and both characters took the encounter a bit too lightly. Jaime should have at least choked him or something. Looks like they are setting up Tyrion to be Dany’s last betrayer. At this point I wouldn’t be surprised if it turns out Tyrion is actually the Mad King’s illegit kid too and he steals the green dragon and takes him to the Lannister side.Cersei is a bit too relaxed and hardcore considering Jaime tells her how they got their asses kicked, the scorpion didn’t work and and that was only one dragon. She kind of Godfathered Jaime with the ‘dont ever betray me again’ line.Jaime actually said that the Dothraki actually outclassed their army. That disproves the theory that the Lannister army would have beaten the Dothraki without the dragon.I wonder what will happen if Lady Mormont meets Jorah? That probably wont go so well.Arya has turned into a complete asshole. Even though her anger seems a bit justified when watching Sansa because she sees Sansa enjoys the authority.I knew Littlefinger was setting her up. Apparently the note was the letter that Sansa wrote after Robert died. (I paused it and read a bit of it) Seems like Littlefinger is trying to sow dissent between the Stark kids because the note makes it look like Sansa sold out their dad.Wasn’t buying the Stark bannermen already rabbling when Jon’s not there. Especially the ones that BS’d and sat out the Battle of the Bastards.It was cool seeing Sam do what he did. They kind of made him out to be a dick last season but he’s turning it around this one.
s07e02	‘Stormborn’, more than any episode in recent memory, puts the politics front and center and justifies why the show is called “Game of Thrones”.Say No to Immigrants!This week on Thrones, Cersei launches a post-truth, alt-facts offensive that would have even the US President taking note(s). Aside from branding Dany as evil, Cersei implores her liege lords to prevent mindless, foreign savages from stealing jobs that rightfully belong to them — like destroying households and raping women.Jaime’s lighter touch seems to sway Randall Tarly later, but every time Jaime uses his wiles now, I start praying that it doesn’t cost him another arm.The scene where Qyburn and Cersei survey the old dragon skulls was hair-raising, until it wasn’t. Seldom has a lack of spending on Defense R&D been as apparent as when Qyburn demonstrates his latest, state-of-the-art weapon — Joffrey’s Crossbow 6S.Why settle for Sexposition, when you can have both, separately?We are effectively served up a “This Week, That Year” Thrones refresher in the opening scenes, but the episode leverages this to deftly demonstrate the motivations of (and dynamics between) the various players — Daenerys, Varys, Tyrion and later Melisandre.I liked how Dany maneuvers the conversation — she wants to inspire loyalty, but realizes that the most useful thing she can ask of Varys is his honesty. Melisandre’s much-predicted arrival in Dragonstone also offers a big hurrah moment for fans of Daenerys and advocates of gender-neutral titles alike.Tyrion proves his worth tenfold this episode, first filtering out phrases that would have resulted in Dany’s mail landing in Jon’s spam folder, and then seemingly crafting the perfect strategy to preempt Cersei’s plan (more on this later). The ever-prickly Lady Olenna however issues a countermand to Dany, and for the second episode in a row, it isn’t obvious as to who is suggesting the right course of action.A rare traditional sex scene (albeit one with neither pillar nor stones) might have sounded the death knell for Greyworm, who having expressed his love to Missandei, will most likely help Dany capture Casterly Rock, but die in the battle. I wager that Jorah, having been sullied but cured by Maester Samwell, will take up his spot in Dany’s ranks.The King Not in the NorthFollowing the insipid years under Stannis, Dragonstone is in dire need of a PR facelift to revive tourist interest. Thankfully, the trio of Sam, Melisandre and Tyrion craft a campaign so good that even Northern Kings can’t help but take a leaf out of Greyworm’s playbook and venture down south.It’s good to see that the friction between Sansa and Jon wasn’t a throwaway moment, as this episode builds on it even more. The show is making it harder than usual for Baelish to leverage this tension to his advantage however, with Jon channeling Season 1 Ned by putting his little neck in a stranglehold. Now that Arya’s all set to arrive back home, things are only going to get tougher for Baelish. Which begs the question — has Westeros’ Chief P.I.M.P forgotten how to hustle?Hello, Old FriendWith his ability to distill information into succinct messages, Hot Pie might have an alternative career lying in store as a news writer for Inshorts. There is a tragic quality to his interaction with Arya, with Arya’s inability to treat him with decency and warmth depicting her loss of innocence more potently than a hundred scenes of her killing men in cold blood.Arya reunites briefly with yet another old friend, but quickly learns that time and Nymeria wait for none. I loved this scene, and suggest you read Deepak Mehta’s awesome answer about it.Actions that Reek of CowardiceB-movie mad man Euron Greyjoy seems to be in possession of Captain Jack Sparrow’s compass, as his pirate armada expertly intercepts Yara’s fleet and ruins Tyrion’s plans. An admittedly tense battle ensues, and following one final bit of terrible Sand Snake dialogue, two of them get sacrificed to the God of Plot-Advancement. The show does a good feint here, as Ellaria and her daughter (whom I’d thought would die) are kept alive presumably as dowry for Queen Cersei.Amidst the carnage, we witness Theon regress into Reek as he abandons ship and lives to fight another day.I could do with a couple of more episodes like this, before we see the Night King again.
s07e02	Our pre-show warning from the Voice of Sky Atlantic:‘…with scenes of a sexual nature…Greyjoy and pain…it’s Game of Thrones!’Roll opening credits and cut to scenes of a Donner und Blitzen nature.Meanwhile, on Dragonstone…We have a war council - Varys does his Man of the People routine, whilst Dany notes that the price of betrayal is a damn good burning - and fails to hide her glee at the possibility that she might get to dish out some fiery justice to someone, anyone.Days since she last burned someone alive?Far too many.Tyrion the Good spends his time like a stuck record reminding Dany that ‘no, remember how we agreed that you weren’t going to burn them all - not even a little bit - not even just the feet of all your subjects - nobody’s doing any burning, how many times do I have to say NO BURNING?’Tyrion the Good recalls that Jon Snow is a good bloke. They should write to Jon because Tyrion has met Jon and Tyrion likes Jon, so they do.If you missed that bit, don’t worry, it will be spelt out painfully again at Winterfell because Jon has met Tyrion and recalls that Tyrion is a good bloke.They really did get on rather well - probably because they are both good blokes.In other news, a plan is put together to attack Casterley Rock, give the Dornish a lift home, and use the Westerosi armies to lay siege to King’s Landing, thus giving the intended starvation of a smallfolk that personal touch.The Dothraki will….where are the Dothraki?You know how it is - you bring a horde of Dothraki home, put them somewhere, and you’re buggered if you can remember where you put them? Where did you last see them? Dunno. You retrace your steps to try to figure out where you would have put them, but they’re not there! Someone moved the Dothraki! Who moved the Dothraki? People never put things away in the right place. God, it’s so annoying.It is instructive that Tommy Lee of the “Motley Crue” actually ended up in jail after losing his temper because he could not find the pan he needed in his own kitchen.The Dothraki are Tommy Lee’s pan, and Dragonstone, his kitchen.In King’s Landing…Cersei gathers the Southren Lords she hasn’t got round to burning to charm them into fighting for her against The Dragon Queen. Cersei the Pot calls out the Dany KettleBlack: look here Southren Lords, you don’t want a Queen who burns people do you? Or subjects them to cruel and unusual punishment?Qyburn has been working on the Dragonkiller 3000 for her.Take that Balerion the Black Dread!Somewhere in the Riverlands…Arya is about to have her own Lassie moment with Nymeria.What’s that Greywind? The Kingslayer’s stuck down the old goat track?Whatever Arya is thinking, Nymeria clearly thinks it a bad idea.Renowned Centre of Learning, the Citadel……finds Samwell Tarly talking Greyscale with Maester JimBroadbent.Horace Slughorn is very sorry, but Greyscale cannot be cured - it’s against the rules, dammit - so, if Sam wants to cure Greyscale, there’ll be no playing it by the book. and he’ll have to go rogue.Not only that, he’s on borrowed time. Patients with Greyscale get shipped to Valyria to be with the Stone Men - Jorah should have already have been couriered, but because he is a Noble Man, he gets One More Day.Wait.Valyria is one of the big mysteries of ASOIAF.Nobody sails to Valyria and survives ( - BookEuron might have, but then he does have a tendency to boast and make things up). Valyria is unknown.But thanks to an off-hand, casual comment, we now know that Valyria is actually a retirement home for people with a disease that the Citadel can’t be arsed to do any research on. There’s probably no money in it.The Citadel are shipping people to Valyria all the time. No problem.Gerion Lannister is likely working as a dinner lady there.Winterfell - and another power point presentation by Jon…Jon’s TED talks have such clunky dialogue that it actually hurts my teeth.He is like a primary school teacher at carpet time.What do we need to do to defeat the Army of the Dead?That’s right - we need fire.Ah, but what also has fire besides a fire?Yes, yes, you with your hand up -yes, dragons - well done!But there’s something else - this is a bit harder - what has fire, but looks like it doesn’t have fire?That’s right! Dragonglass. Now, where do we find Dragonglass?(Stannis told us at great length two seasons ago…)No, don’t shout out! Yes, Davos the Just A Simple Man, Dragonstone - have a sticker.Repeat ad nauseum - plus a few ‘I’ve met Tyrion he’s a good bloke’- s.In Which We Find Littlefinger Lurking In The Basement…Here’s how it went in Littlefinger’s head:Graciously welcome Jon into my His Family Crypt.Admire effigy of Ned Stark.DO NOT say that Ned Stark’s effigy looks like an upside down melted welly with a face drawn on by a two year old. Pro-tip: those Starks are prickly about their honour. Admire my own cunning, quietly.Assure Jon about my intentions re. Sansa, by explaining that I had wanted to bang - no, not bang - loved her mother, but unfortunately she’s dead in the show, and a re-animated corpse with an attitude problem and fingernail raked face in the books. You just wouldn’t, would you? Jon therefore owes me one Sansa.Share manly bro-ment now that Jon understands that I am not a creepy middle-aged man lurking after his teenage sister. Creepy lurkers don’t fixate on young girls for good reasons, like the ones I have.Admire my own cunning, quietly. Allow a knowing smirk.How it actually went:On one of the Fourteen Seas…All is calm. All is bright.Yara’s below decks touching up Ellaria - the reaction of the male in our house was to laugh and say ‘oh, please’ in a disparaging manner, rather than the ‘oh, there might be some hot girl on girl action here’ look the show must have been going for, since there was no other reason for that shit.You know when you’re a kid, that there’s always that uncle?The one who chases the kids round the garden, plays all the stupid games, gets them to fire water pistols at Grandma - kids love him, right? - he’s so much fun.But he always goes that bit too far.The kids are laughing, they’re happy, they’re happy…oh no, now they’re all crying…and your mum gives Fun Uncle a really good telling off.I think we all remember that time we were below decks with a Dornish character ruined by the show, about to get a bit…well, never mind…and there was a tremendous banging, but it was coming from outside?We ran up the stairs with our traumatised brother - missing several bodily parts - to see what all the commotion was about! What could it be?Typical.It was fun uncle Euron lowering a gang plank and shouting ‘Raaaahhhhh!’ as he charged towards us with his axe, whilst his daft mates set fire to everything!What is he like?Uncle Euron played with all the children on the boat - especially the two little Dornish girls - then, he did that thing where he pulls a funny face, pretends he’s crazy, going ‘give your uncle a kiss!’ He even pushed our brother in the sea without using his hands! How we laughed.Then we all went home for tea. The End.
s07e02	I liked it better than the 1st episode. The first episode was basically a recap, 'previously on GoT'.It is worth mentioning there are parts I still disliked and found illogical.Storms and rain in Dragonstone. How fitting for 'the Stormborn' to be ruling there. Maybe, the gods of Westeros wept when Dany was born and they are weeping now that she has returned. Is this symbolic of Dany bringing chaos and storm? Dany suggests 'it still doesn't feel like home'. Ok, I knew she would complain. Dragonstone is supposed to have lovely 'red doors'. I guess she doesn't like this shade of red. I can imagin her sitting the iron throne and complaining of the cold steel.Finally, the show has decided to address some plot holes. Dany approaches Varys on the assassination attempt. They were waiting for the cameras. A possible 3-6 month boat journey from Slavers Bay to Dragonstone was spent in silence. Now, Dany is addressing the issue. Varys stands his ground. Rightly so. Dany had a bone to pick. And they both got what they wanted. This does leave the door open to Varys leaving Dany's side if she goes batshit and starts burning everything with her dragons. Dany threatens another person with 'I will burn you alive'. Gee, I wonder who has said that before? The Mad King!The war council has Tyrion and Ellaria addressing another lingering issue. Myrcella's death. Tyrion growls a bit and then lets it go. This is just not on. This is not the real Tyrion. He loved Myrcella and Tommen. He loves Jaime. He wouldn't let the death of his niece go with a sideways look. But now he has. So fuck you, show Tyrion. Really. I wonder how he will deal with Olenna when he finds out she framed him for murder. I am betting on a frown and a hiss, but no more.A decent plan is made to address the Dothraki issue. No one likes them in Westeros. So Dany is sending the Tyrells and Dornish to perish in KL. Tyrion correctly wants to attack the Lannister home base. From the trailers, it is obvious that the Unsullied sneak in through some cave like structure in the Rock, and succeed in the opening the castle doors to their comrads. I am not sure if they will use the pretext of Tyrion's knowledge with drains or have created a random hole in the Rock's wall. You know, easy access for enemy invaders.Greyworm announces the visitor. It had to be Mel. She has decided Dany has a part to play. Did she see this in her fires too? Has she been seeing more visions sent from R'hllor? That guy could make it easier and send it all at once to Mel. Dany eats up the part about her being a possible saviour and asks for another bowl. Mel conveniently leaves out that Jon Snow is more than a man. He has risen back from the dead. Tyrion responds positively to Jon Snow. No one mentions that Sansa is ruling beside Jon, or that she is with her brother. I would like to see Tyrion's reaction to Sansa. Dany demands that Jon bend the knee to her (I will forever hate Jon if he does so). Because she is somehow more rightful to these lands compared to a man whose house has dwelt within Westeros for over 8000years. And is an elected and loved king.Olenna chats with Dany. She encourages Dany to use her dragons. Which I am sure Dany will in the next episode against Jaime and the Lannister army when invading Casterly Rock.Winterfell! Finally, the leaders are discussing the issues at hand BEFORE they go in front of all the lords and bannermen. Unlike last week. The language in Tyrion's letter is interesting and VERY different to what Dany commanded. Does Tyrion think a softer tone helps lure Jon south and then have him forced to bend the knee? Or, does he think he can convince Dany to treat Jon as an equal? Jon responds positively to Tyrion's letter. Specially, after reading their personal little anecdot. Sansa is right in suggesting to be careful. Every Stark who has ridden south lately has died. Jon will be the first to come back alive, I think. He will also be very surprised to see he has been commanded to bend the knee and not treat with Dany.Cersei! I respect this conniving woman far more than Dany. Both in the books and the show. She goes for what she wants. She gets down and dirty and suffers the good with the bad. She lays out all the shit Dany has been getting up to in Essos. The foreign legions she has brought who are savages. And she is right. Despite Dany's intentions, mass scale crucifixion and burnings are not a sign of love and wisdom from a monarch. Cersei demands assistance from the Reach lords headed by Randyll. Jaime rightly suspects Randyll might not assist them. He reminds Randyll that an oath to the crown supercedes the oath to the liege lord. Randyll seems stern, loyal and strong. But he must have ambitions too. Jaime offers him dominion over all of the Reach which is a pretty handsom offer. Dickon has grown immensely since last season. What does he put in his water?Oldtown! Here we have the real heir to house Botlon. Samwell Bolton, Sam the Slayer, now also Sam the Flayer. How is Jorah surviving this technique? Will he grow normal skin underneath? Won't a full body flaying crack and fester? Does it not lead to death? So many unanswered questions. But Jorah is cured. So yippee. Sam's actions and questioning of the lead maesters may have him kicked out. Or he will probably join Jorah to go to Dragonstone and convince Dany of the threat of the White walkers. Sam is networking. He is building connection with both the north and the south. His whole plot in the Citadel is a waste. He is curing greyscale which won't even spread in Westeron on the show. He is doing nothing. We knew about dragonglass two seasons ago. I miss Stannis.Arya! This is my favorite bit of the episode. Yes, it is an average part. But Arya finally decides to go north!!! The moment Hot Pie told her that Jon Snow is king in the north, and Arya had a shocked look, I got goosebumps. I can't believe Arya didn't know anything of the north even though she has been roaming the Riverlands killing the Freys. News gets around. But she didn't know. Good on you, Hot Pie!!! He thinks Arya is pretty. Cool. She has the Ned Stark hairstyle. I knew she would go north despite her hesitation.Qyburn! I guess the dragonskulls have a different purpose in the books. On the show, they get crushed by a bolt. Something that Cersei and every other educated person in Westeros should have known. Meraxes died that way almost 300years ago. When Cersei suggested that a plan against the dragons is being hatched, I assumed Qyburn had some form of magic. But it is a bolt. A bit obvious. Bolts kill flying creatures. I am betting on Viserion to go down first.Greyworm and Missandei. First set of boobs in season 7. Oh look, we get Greyworm's butt as a bonus. For a eunuch with no sex education or experience, he seems to know what he is doing. And he is good at it!! Modern humans must suck big time to go through sex ed and still be mediocre at sex the first time. Why did the show think this scene is more important than...let's say....hm, I don't know....a person who can control the fate of fucking world, Bran!!!! Too bad you can't fast forward these scenes.Another raven at Winterfell from Sam. Great information, fatboy. You got to do more than to earn your shit-food at the Citadel. Jon is very quick to jump on board for any sort of information or alliance he can get against the White walkers. He is too hasty. Which is not like Jon. Something has to blow up in his face sooner than later.Jon argues with the bannermen and leaves them more antagonized than ever. This has to lead to something. Jon claims he was elected and is doing the right thing. But the lords don't seem convinced.Sit down, Lyanna Mormont! Bear Island is not large, nor influential enough to have you constantly standing up shouting. You are right in this instance. But where are the types of big northern lords who fought each other on who should lead Robb's van? We have a Glover. And then Mormont. What happend to the skinny dude who was passed for a Cerwyn. Manderly, anyone?Jon leaves Sansa in control. Good choice. Logical choice. She is the only other Stark in Winterfell. She is a bit more ruthless, a bit more cautious, which is what the north prefers. I think Sansa won this episode's battle of logic with Jon. She seems wary and careful. With reason! Brienne has a little smile on her face. Meh! Everyone you protect dies or gets maimed, girl. Let's see how you can protect Sansa.Contrary to what most people predicted, I knew Baelish wouldn't reveal Jon's parentage. This is Baelish's monologue from the second trailer. The 'king in the north' part was cut in the trailer making everyone think this speech was directed at Sansa. I called it to be something about Sansa. And it is. Jon slams him against the wall. Ned's likeness watches the same thing he did once, in silence. LF is right that he was never thanked for his assistance. Sansa and Jon are pissing on him for the help he provided. He at least deserves that recognition. Baelish loosening his neck muscles. I hope he twists some webs and causes a bit of chaos. I am getting bored of this new loser Baelish stalking Sansa and being creepy.Arya meets Nymeria. Nothing to worry about. Nymeria will follow Arya. It was strongly implied that Nymeria recognized her. Otherwise a direwolf and her savage pack would have ripped a human apart. Nymeria will probably wait till Arya is in danger and then run to the rescue. Or follow her till she does go to Winterfell. There was a wolf pack. It symbolized that the Starks will all unite in Winterfell. That is when Ghost and Nymeria will join them as well.Greyjoy fleet. Floating. Sandbrats in the deck below. Momma, momma, momma. Once again, why is this part necessary more than Bran? Then, we have randy Ellaria deploying for a foreign invasion. Thank god for show Euron. Never thought I would say that about him. He arrives. He has a bit of Victarion in him the way he fights. He kicks the shit out the Sandbrats. More goosebumps for me. He impaled Obarra on her own spear and hang Nymeria with her own whip. Freaking awesom!!!! And then he got Yarra. Theon regressed to his fearful state due to PTSD. He flees and he will be the one who gets the message to Dany in Dragonstone. How did Tyene hold off large men wielding long swords coming at her with a knife? Whatever, she is caught now. Yay! Thank you, show Euron!Overall, I liked the episode better than the first one. Things got moving. Dany showed more of her true colours which we have come to expect. Cersei was right and cunning. Jon was un-Jon like and hasty whilst Sansa was cautious and clever. Dany got defeated in one battle at least. Which is quite satisfying. I wonder what she will do now to mobilize her armies. Her fleet is gone. So if the Unsullied and the Dothraki make it to the shores of Westeros, it should be a miracle. The Ironborn did not have that many spare ships to leave too many behind in Dragonstone. She will probably start burning shit now in her rage. Thank you for adding fuel to the fire, Olenna.I expect Jon to be welcomed into a very different scene in Dragonstone compared to what he expected from Tyrion's letter. Baelish will cause a rift between Sansa and Jon, the lords should side with Sansa over Jon considering what Jon is doing at the moment. I think Tyrion may play referee between Jon and Dany. He may propose a marriage. Between Jon and Dany. Though, I hope not. It would be nice to get Davos, Mel, Dany, Jon and Tyrion in one room going at each other. Davos should call out Mel for burning people. Dany will scold Mel. Which is rich considering she burns people or always threatens to. A mention of Sansa should come up too. How will Tyrion deal with his wife? Non-wife? Ex-wife?I liked Arya turning north. Nymeria recognized her and will definitely follow. I wonder if she will run into the Hound and BwB again on the way to the north. I am 99% sure that the Hound will reveal Baelish's betrayal to the girls.I loved the death of the Sandbrats. I predicted that Yarra will be a gift for Cersei. And she will be. I hope Cerei unleashes Gregor on Tyene. And then send her in pieces to Dany and Tyrion.Sam's part is very disappointing. He is adding nothing to the story and plot. Where the hell is Bran? He is one of the most important characters in the books, maybe as much as Jon. But he is missing. Most of the show is revolving around Jon, Dany and Cersei. As expected since one is the villain whilst the other two are fan favorites. With snippets of Sam. I can't believe the show is making Tyrion look past the murder of Myrcella. Book Tyrion would scheme and have Ellaria burnt by a dragon.Episode 3 should follow the same path. A war between the Unsullied and the Lannisters in the west. Casterly Rock may fall whilst all the Lannister army gets burnt by Drogon. I think this is where we will see Jaime riding with a spear through the burning field. Once again, where is Bran?
s07e02	(Spoilers Galore) This was an uneven episode, ranging from some well done scenes to necessary events to why in God’s name do we have to watch this part. Let’s start with the sections that worked well and work our way downward:BestSam and Jorah: I didn’t expect to like this as much as I did. It does seem rather convenient for Jorah to get healed of greyscale when others have died in droves. Since I knew that Jorah was going to join Daenerys later on from leaked photos, I didn’t expect it to be interesting, but it was. Sam knew Jorah’s name from his father, Jeor. He respected Jeor and mourned his death. Saving Gilly from the Nights Watch brothers who mutinied, brought out the best in Sam, as he found the courage to protect Gilly and the baby by killing a White Walker. In this scene, he decides that Jorah Mormont will not die. So he puts him through an agonizing healing session that makes a spinal tap look like cotton candy. Yes, it was gross, but it made sense that Sam would find a way to heal Jorah. This may earn him his maester chain quicker, and gain the respect of Archmaster Embrose or he may get tossed out without his chain, but ready to join Jon anyway. (I would like for Sam to complete his training, but it may not happen.) It also may help Jon Snow who is on his way to see Daenerys. Once she finds out that Jon’s best friend healed her loyal friend, she may feel more inclined to listen to Jon’s conditions. I bet we find Jorah healthy and ready to kick some Lannister behind very soon. Even though I knew I was emotionally manipulated, I liked this part of the show—I did.GoodArya: She meets Hot Pie and Nymeria. So it wasn’t all that complicated. All she needed to hear from Hot Pie that Jon Snow is now the King in the North and the Boltons are dead. Poof. She will now go North. Maybe Hot Pie is Azor Ahai. The meeting with Nymeria and her pack was superb. Her dire wolf has grown. Will the pack follow Arya to the North? (I say yes.) Does she turn away from Arya because her main responsibility is her pack, just as Arya is now responsible to help Sansa rule the North in Jon’s stead? I think we will see Nymeria again, and that is a good thing for the Starks as we have yet to see Ghost, plus we need to see their animal representation as much as we see Dany’s dragons. I expect a huge homecoming in Winterfell soon of remaining Stark humans and direwolves, along with supporters.Kings Landing: Cersei brought the lords from the Reach, and tried to scare them into obedience with tales from the dark side of the Mad King’s daughter(and she did crucify the masters, so let’s not pretend otherwise.) Will Randyll Tarly betray his oath to House Tyrell and fight with Cersei against Daenarys? Jaime tried to tempt him with a promise to be Warden of the South as well as a ranking general. Randyll listened, but spoke of his oath, reminding Jaime that he is a Tarly and that name means something. I cannot help but like this guy with his gruff justice and determined duty. I really want to know what he is going to do. My guess is that he will join Jaime in fighting the Tyrell army, but he will realize that he cannot go through with it. Then he will fight with the Tyrells, and this is where Dickon may die and Randyll feels he has lost everything that matters. Then he will join Daenerys Targaryen. I may be wrong, but I just don’t see this guy sticking it out with Cersei. He may influence Jaime to get with the program, even though I expect Jaime to stay with Cersei all season.Winterfell: As long as I have to see Littlefinger slithering his way along the paths of the North, I won’t be completely happy with the otherwise good depiction of the North. Jon has made it clear that he did not want to be king, but he will do the best he can, even if the lords and ladies of the North don’t agree with his decision. Jon is at his best in “Stormborn” as he is thinking of the future, not his popularity. He vouches for Sam, who tells him of the dragonstone, and tells everyone that Tyrion is a good man. Okay. The show has made it clear that Tyrion is a good guy, and we shall not forget. So he and Davos will meet Daenerys, and try to get her support to fight the White Walkers. Will she ask him to bend the knee? Will he relive the agony of Torrhen Stark, who knelt before the Conqueror to avoid a bloodbath? Jon may agree to bend the knee in exchange for some White Walker support—maybe a dragon or two, but please, keep the Dothraki—we prefer Unsullied. I’m not looking forward to this meeting, but I suspect it will tell us a lot about Daenerys and whether she deserves to be considered Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Jon will probably come off a lot better. And no, I don’t think he is walking into a trap. However, Littlefinger had to make his intentions toward Sansa clear to Jon. (I love your sister so much that I made her marry a raping sadist.) Lord Baelish, your arc in this show has ended.FairDragonstone: I liked the look of the small council meeting, Olenna got all the good lines. Tyrion is the voice of reason, urging Daenerys to remember that she will not be a queen of ashes. Call me paranoid, but I felt I was seeing a lot of foreshadowing at Dragonstone. First, Daenerys takes issue with Varys, saying that he was loyal to Robert and really backed her brother, who was weak and stupid. She tells Varys that he had no problem betraying the Lannisters when it suited him, so how can she trust him? Well, Dany, you have a Hand of the King who killed his father. Ellaria and her brood killed their anointed prince. Really, you just aren’t attracting the 1%. Varys told her that he was not born to a noble family (read: I am not a Blackfyre). He serves the people because that is what he is—a former slave who had to suffer under despots. Dany makes him promise that he will not go behind her back, that he will confront her with her weaknesses if he feels the need to betray her. Hmmm. Does this mean that Varys will dump Daenerys sometime in, ah, Season 8? Is Dany’s distrust the beginning of a paranoid episode? Is this a sign that she will soon trust no one? Will she go the way of Aerys II? She spent a boat ride keeping all of this to herself. Only Yara and Tyrion made sense: Yara was right to say that they should attack King’s Landing as they will be regrouping while Daenerys comes in full force. Good advice, but Dany decided that Olenna should go to Highgarden and Ellaria and company must go back to Dorne. That was not smart. Tyrion was right to make sure Daenerys doesn’t get too angry with Varys as it was an odd conversation, but he was wrong to urge caution in starting a battle. Now Yara is a prisoner, along with Ellaria, and Cersei will get her priceless gift. Other than Targaryen blood, why does this woman think she has the right to rule?SighThe Euron Battle: I still loathe show Euron, but at least the show runners want to ensure that we believe he can fight and kill people. I like Yara very much, and Theon is one of my favorite characters in the book and show. But I really don’t give a damn about Ellaria and the Sand Snakes—I have no respect for what they did to Prince Doran, and I find them unbelievable as rulers. So it is a testimony to the scene that I found myself fearful when Euron got a hold of the Sand Snakes and killed two of them. (Nymeria and Obara—thank you for the correction, Kelsey.) Euron has Yara, Ellaria and Tyene. I suspect the two dead Sand Snakes are the lucky ones as they died quickly. I don’t think Yara is going to die, but we can say our goodbyes to Ellaria and her remaining Sand Snake who have overstayed their welcome as far as I’m concerned. Euron was actually a bit scary, and Theon had a flashback to his PTSD from his time with Ramsay. Could he have saved Yara from Euron? No, he would have gotten killed and hurt her chances for survival. So Theon may end up saving his sister, and I hope he does. It would be nice if he could kill Euron, and put us out of our misery, but I think we are stuck with him for Season 7.Just STOP!We don’t know what is happening to Edmure Tully. We didn’t see Bran in this episode. But we had to have a long love scene between Grey Worm and Missandei. What the hell? This is something that only the show runners must care about, as I have yet to meet one fan who would rather watch Grey Worm and Missandei have show biz sex than see something actually happen to further the plot. Really. Can’t we get back to the Night King and those really cool wight giants? We didn’t need that scene, and we never will.I want to like this episode more than I do. I am rooting for Theon and Yara. Dany annoys me, not only because the show made me sick of her, but I just find her sense of privilege irritatingly smug, plus I see no leadership skills like I do with Jon Snow. I am glad Randyll Tarly will be a larger presence in the show, but I dread what I think awaits Olenna as I expect Jaime to lay siege to Highgarden in episode 3. I will be glad once all the Starks get to Winterfell as the show will feel less fragmented. And please: don’t waste any more show minutes on Grey Worm and Missandei.
s07e02	As was the case for last week, this is part review, part recap.I liked this one. A lot. It had its dipshit moments and some heavy-handed moments but I feel like they know where they’re going, which is more than I would have said before the season kicked off.The opening with the storm over Dragonstone is auspicious. I really like how this was done. It flirts with Dany being both self-aware and egotistical, Varys being both populist and conniving, Tyrion playing referee. Varys tells Dany the truth, Dany challenges Varys on his motives. They both have a point. Dany’s threat to burn Varys alive if he betrays her is sort of a “haha wink wink” bit but she’s actually done that to people before, so. This isn’t cute hyperbole — you might think Varys deserves it if he backs off of her, sure, but she will do it.Called it (as did most people, surely). Dany’s visitor is Melisandre. And Melisandre has pivoted from Stannis to Jon to Dany in terms of who’s the prince(ss) that was promised (at least, she lets Dany believe that, although as others have pointed out she stop short of saying she now thinks it’s Dany). I must say it’s a bit strange for Melisandre to hold back a pretty critical bit of info on Jon, namely that he came back from the dead. Tyrion, expectedly, has a positive opinion of Jon. Melisandre leaves out that Jon’s been dead but perhaps she wants Jon to tell Dany that himself? Seems like burying the lede.Aside: Melisandre told Jon he was the PTWP and he brushed it off. Dany, as I completely expected — I’m only surprised it didn’t happen last season in Meereen — is self-satisfied at the idea of fulfilling this prophecy. She’s enjoying the spotlight of it and it feeds into her savior complex. Yet another contrast between the two.And there goes the hammer: Dany wants to meet Jon but she frames it as him coming to his queen to bend the knee. (Again, completely expected that Dany would frame a potential meeting this way; the catch is if it sticks.)Winterfell. Looking sharp. Jon, Sansa and Davos are going over Tyrion’s note. It’s funny to me that Jon seems more trusting of Tyrion than Sansa. Sansa notes that Tyrion is nice but she’s still wary, smartly. Davos, bless him, hits on fire killing wights. This would have been a much better proactive reason to go to Dragonstone than the obsidian Sam stumbled upon (again?), but I guess better late than never.EDIT: It hit me that Tyrion’s note, at least what we read/heard of it, did not seem to explicitly demand submission and fealty from Jon. Did Tyrion leave it out intentionally thinking Jon would balk if he included it? Was it unintentional? Is Jon going to show up to Dragonstone thinking, based on Tyrion’s note, he’s negotiating among equals only for Dany to demand submission? If Tyrion left it out intentionally, what’s his plan for when it comes up?This, with Cersei, is goddamn brilliant, because: Cersei accuses Dany of nothing she didn’t actually do. Sure, she leaves out the context of it, but the actual acts — mass crucifixions and feeding people to her dragons — Dany’s guilty of. It’s a great way to finally flip the context around Dany that I keep talking about. Even what Cersei says about the Dothraki rings true.I’m guessing that in the book, Tarly ends up siding with Aegon but with Aegon cut they shifted him to the Lannisters (I suspect he just has to fight Dany, whatever else he does and whomever for). Wild guess. This is another nice bit of complexity, because on the one hand Randyll’s an asshole, but on the other, he’s still Sam’s dad and Jaime argues a strong case. No easy sides here.The Oldtown stuff is the second-weakest part of the episode. However, if you’d told me that Jorah’s world-wide search for a greyscale cure would lead him to Sam, I wouldn’t have believed it. I think it’s pretty limp-dick to make Sam’s raison d’etre at the Citadel be 1. dragonglass, something he already knew was there and 2. curing Jorah, but with the Faceless Men cut back I guess they had to do something else with him. Seems like a waste to me of what could be a pretty interesting side plot (literally any information could plausibly be in the Citadel).Dragon skulls! This was so cool. I’m only surprised that we don’t get the backstory of Meraxes and how she died, since that would only bolster Cersei’s case. Also: If that big fuckin’ bolt doesn’t kill or at least hit one of those dragons, I will crane-kick a kitten. This is Chekhov’s bolt, damn it.It all looks so easy, doesn’t it! Army, fleet, dragons, boom done! I call 100% bullshit on Tyrion just sort of tsk’ing his niece’s murder, though. It is nice to know though that Dany’s plot armor doesn’t extend to the “best-laid plans” trope. The plan as they lay it out is a good one, using Westerosi to take the capital and the foreign hordes to seize enemy territory. On paper, it looks smart. On paper!I’m not sure what to make of Dany’s chat with Olenna. It could end up being nothing or everything. The entire reason Dany has Tyrion is so she has someone smart who knows Westeros, and now Olenna is telling her to ignore him and go full-on dragon. Dany might resist that impulse as long as plans are working, but what will she do when her plans go to shit?I fast-forwarded through the entire Grey Worm/Missandei sex scene once it was clear what it was. I feel like I missed absolutely nothing. (Luckily this episode had this to keep the Oldtown stuff from being the low point.)I’m gonna need more from Oldtown than Sam playing forensic pathologist. Also: Sam didn’t have it bad enough last week with the chamber pots? Now we need Jorah’s oozing cracked flesh? No thanks.Jorah, her name is Daenerys. Not khaleesi. Rookie mistake!The edit cut to Arya’s pie is delightful. Bringing back Hot Pie was inspired and only shows how far Arya’s come. It’s a beautiful contrast. Also: If I didn’t expect Sam to help Jorah’s greyscale, I really, really, really did not ever expect Hot Pie to clue Arya in about Jon and the North.As soon as the Stark theme started playing over Arya leaving the inn, I knew she’d be going back home. When she turned her horse I said, “That’s a girl.”Jon has already been summoned to Dragonstone and Davos has already pointed out that dragons can kill wights — do we really need the dragonglass thing? Or at least, could we not get a reminder that “Stannis says Dragonstone has dragonglass too”?So does Sam know Jon is King in the North now or not? As of the end of the last season Sam thought Jon was still lord commander of the Night’s Watch (itself super outdated at that point) but now Sam’s ravens are going to Winterfell. Uh?This exchange with Jon and Sansa and the bannermen reminds me strongly of Tyrion arguing with Missandei and Grey Worm about the wisdom of cutting a deal with the slavers. That ended up blowing up in Tyrion’s face. So who’s going to be right here? Jon for wanting to be proactive about an alliance, or Sansa and Co. for advising caution? Jon, of course, is looking for a straight-up alliance. Dany is expecting a supplicant offering fealty. Who blinks first or do they meet in the middle?Jon leaving Sansa in charge of the North was expected but also wholly welcome. I flirted with the idea, for a second, that Jon might actually transfer his title to Sansa — making her Queen in the North — as a compromise, but he’s right that only royalty can cut a deal with Dany. Leaving her in charge seems sufficient and if Dany burns him alive (hahaha), Sansa can easily slide into the role.Aside: The Jon-Sansa alliance is transitioning nicely. Jon proactively asks Sansa’s advice on how to read Tyrion, and he hands the reins to her while he’s gone. That takes a massive amount of trust. Sansa seems surprised, honored and pleased when he does it. It’s a nice moment. I also love Brienne’s little smile.This is the most awk convo ever. Baelish is like “Aw I love Cat,” and Jon has to be thinking, “… Dude. Dude.” Baelish is correct that Jon owes him for the Vale knights. Jon is also correct to throttle the shit out of him for perving on Sansa. Berserker Jon from the books makes an all-too-brief appearance. Jon’s silhouette as he leaves the crypt is wonderfully framed — imposing yet filling a relatively small part of the frame.Now I just wonder what Baelish has up his sleeve if he thinks Jon’s going to cockblock him with Sansa and/or Sansa will reject him.Here’s my take on Arya and Nymeria: Arya isn’t enough of a Stark yet to be worthy of her direwolf. She’s still consumed by vengeance. She’s on the right path, going to Winterfell instead of to King’s Landing, but it will take time. I also loved the touch that the regular wolves surrounding Arya — at least the ones featured — had the same coloring as the Starks’ other direwolves: black, white, gray, etc. (Intentional or not, I noticed it immediately.) Not only did Nymeria reject Arya, but the pack also rejected her by extension. Arya has to become worthy again not only of her own individual direwolf, but of the pack itself.The good Greyjoys’ fleet. The Sand Snakes are still annoying as shit. Did we have Theon slip into the Victarion role just to be Ellaria’s beer wench? And there’s Yara and Ellaria making out; glad we got that over with.In hindsight, Yara saying Theon would be her protector should have been a red flag. It’s like, “We’ll speak again when I return.”I was not expecting such a big fight so soon but good lord this was glorious. They still have a long way to go to make Euron EURON but this was a good start. They have Euron the stab-happy psycho down, now they need to up his scheming and intelligence a bit. But I’ll take it.Euron kills two of those fucking annoying Sand Snakes and kidnaps the third, along with Ellaria, and he’s … the bad guy? That is not fair, people.Not what I expected Euron to do with Yara. I thought Theon would hesitate and Euron would open her throat. Theon choosing to jump into the water is, in comparison, almost blackly comedic. And what’s he going to do now, swim back to Dragonstone and explain that Euron kidnapped Yara, Ellaria and Tyene? How’s that going to go?So to recap: The force that was going to besiege King’s Landing so Dany wouldn’t have to do it with Dothraki has lost its navy and two of Dany’s three regional leaders. Euron has hostages to take to Cersei to do God only knows what with. (We know that next week Cersei, um, returns a gift, but … eeesh. Hard to see any of those three women just being let go so it makes you wonder what “return” entails, really.)This might affect how and if Dany takes what Olenna said to heart. Ellaria and Yara aren’t there anymore to offer alternative voices to Olenna. And the King’s Landing siege plan (Tyrion’s brainchild, based on how it was sold) has gone to hell, so does Dany go scorched earth now like Olenna suggested, even disregarding Tyrion’s advice?Final thoughts: Strong episode. Weak parts were, as I said, the meh direction they’re taking the Citadel in and that complete waste of time that was Missandei and Grey Worm’s sex scene. (Who did they make that for, exactly?) The show needed to put some chinks in Dany’s armor to make the result feel less inevitable and I think it succeeded. We also got nice set-up of the Jon/Dany meeting and how it might pan out, although I wish the show had picked one thing and stuck to it — Are they going for dragonglass? Are they going for allies? Are they going because Dany ordered them to? — instead of throwing the kitchen sink at Jon’s decision to go. I’m relieved Arya found common sense (thanks, Hot Pie!) and I hope she gets to see her wolf again in better days.
s06e08	My review of the episode :)“A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell. And I’m going home.”There’s only so much a die-hard fan can take of appetizing and table-setting; even on a brilliant show like Game of Thrones, and especially when a lot of it doesn’t make narrative sense. If the last few episodes were all about slow-burning buildups, this was much more of the same, even as the fantastic preview of this week’s episode promised so much more.Read on.http://economydecoded.com/2016/0...
s06e05	★★★★★ - Why 5/5 : Game of Thrones Season 6 Episode 5 (The Door) was easily the most emotionally powerful of the season so far, and probably the most intense I can remember since the burning of princess Shireen in Season 5.Note: I’m reviewing “Game of Thrones” from the perspective of someone who has read all of George R.R. Martin’s novels and watched the TV show till latest episode.[Spoilers for those who are yet to watch the episode]Here we go for full review:I never thought much about Hodor when reading the books, or really when watching the show. It wasn’t until this season when, a few episodes back, we see in one of Bran’s visions that Hodor was not always Hodor. That he could speak.Hodor. (Credit: HBO)That was curious. Until the end. And it makes me want to cry.Bran is lost in a vision, taken there by the Three Eyed Raven, taken back not to witness his father departing for the Vale, but to somehow commune with Willas, Hodor’s past self, a great big boy who whose life would change forever for one purpose: To hold the door. To save Bran and Meera. To foil the intentions of the Night’s King. This guy:The Night’s King (Credit: HBO)In all six seasons of Game of Thrones I have never once felt truly surprised and moved at the same time.Many of the biggest and most terrible events—Ned’s beheading or the Red Wedding or the wickedness of Ramsay Snow—were in the first five of George R.R. Martin’s books. Diversions from the book were either welcome but not terribly important—much of the streamlining in the show, for instance—or infuriating and pointless, like the burning of Stannis’s daughter.But this came as a huge surprise to me. Hodor isn’t just a big dumb giant of a man, he’s a hero. His whole entire life was fated for this one moment, for him to hold the door against an unspeakable evil, to save a boy and a girl. I have been moved. Truly moved and a little flabbergasted, to boot. The show has done something special tonight, something unexpected but not simply for shock and awe. This was touching and tragic and powerful. Hodor became a hero tonight. He sacrificed himself, and his entire life, for this brief moment.Hold the door.Hodor.Let’s stay here in the frozen wastes beyond the Wall for a while. It’s cold, but I feel warm from all the revelations.Meera. Credit: HBONorth of the Wall: Meera and the Children of the ForestNorth of the Wall had all the best bits in Sunday night’s episode of Game of Thrones. Beyond the tragic revelations surrounding Hodor, we had two other important moments.The first dealt with the weird, branchy-looking folk we know as the Children of the Forest. These are the “elves” of Game of Thrones. They lived in the land now known as Westeros long before the First Men arrived. And when the men arrived, conflict ensued. What we discover in tonight’s episode is that the Children, in a misguided effort to beat back the tide of humankind, used dark magic to create a weapon: The White Walkers. We aren’t given a very detailed explanation of how this worked or what came directly after. Suffice to say, like most weapons of tremendous power, the White Walkers were more than the Children of the Forest could handle. It’s the story of Frankenstein’s monster, or the nuclear bomb. The White Walkers became enemies of their creators, and in tonight’s episode, they slaughter them. Maybe not all of them, but all that were there with Bran and the Three-Eyed Raven.The second big deal in the cave has to do with Meera Reed. At one point, one of the Children of the Forest grabs a spear and thrusts it into the long-haired White Walker. This WW plucks the spear out of his chest and kills the elf in almost the same movement. But then Meera picks up a spear and lobs it into the Walker’s chest and the creature turns into ice and shatters, much like a slightly colder version of the Wicked Witch of the West.This seems important to me. Was this a spear tipped with Dragon Glass? (Obsidian.) Or is it specifically because it was Meera who threw the spear that matters? Like Jon Snow, she’s killed a White Walker now. Is it really the weapon that matters, or is it the hand that wields it?Credit: HBOWe are going to talk spoilers/book spoilers/fan theories which I happen to support real quick:I’ve never much cared for the theory that Meera Reed is, in fact, Jon Snow’s twin. The idea is that Meera and Jon were both born to Lyanna Stark in the Tower of Joy when Ned finds them. He’s there with Howland Reed, the only two survivors of the battle against Arthur Dayne and the King’s Guard. Ned takes Jon back to Winterfell and claims him as his own. Howland takes Meera back with him to the swamps and claims her as his own. The two are never told they’re brother and sister, or that they’re the children of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen.I always thought this was a bit of a stretch, and that while the R+L = J theory was obviously true, the R+L = J & M theory was far-fetched. But after tonight’s episode, I think I may have to whistle a different tune. Let me know if you feel the same or if I’m crazy or simply missed something.Castle Black:First let me say this: Sansa is so much more awesome than she used to be. Perhaps a bit too hot-headed, but you can hardly blame her. She reminds me of a somewhat more determined Catelyn, without all the irrationality.We get a couple great Sansa scenes in “The Door.” At least a couple weeks must have passed at this point. Not only has Littlefinger traveled all the way from the Vale to Mole’s Town, Sansa’s had time to make Jon a really excellent fur coat.In any case, Sansa meets with Littlefinger in Mole’s Town and basically tells him that he’s a lying sack of cow dung. She forces him to tell her what he thinks Ramsay did to her after she was abandoned with the Boltons. Baelish, for once, seems lost for words. He does, eventually, convey to her that her uncle, Brynden the Blackfish, has retaken Riverrun and marshaled an army. That’s sort of an odd favor, though, since we can assume Littlefinger wants Jon and Sansa to use his army from the Vale. As always, his plots and plans are a bit inscrutable.Credit: HBOLater, Sansa lies to Jon and everyone else when they ask where she learned of the Blackfish’s victories in the Riverlands. Later, Brienne asks her why she lied, and Sansa doesn’t answer. I think it’s because she doesn’t want Jon to be tempted with the promise of an army from a man she no longer trusts. No doubt the offer would be tempting, since an army from the Vale—the one kingdom untouched by war at this point, other than Dorne—would tip the scales in their favor against the Boltons.But Sansa wants to play the game on her own terms, and her and Jon and Davos agree to go out and recruit as many of the Northern vassals as they can. I’m glad they finally mentioned the Manderly’s, too. Perhaps there’s pie in the show’s future after all.So Jon and Sansa set out, though Brienne is off to meet with the Blackfish. I’m not sure I agree with sending her away. Podrick would have been a perfectly fine messenger. At least a retinue of sorts accompanies our heroes. The Red Lady, Podrick Payne, Davos Seaworth, Tormund Giantsbane (who is still making hilariously wonderful eyes at Brienne of Tarth. and I love it) They go to rally the North against Ramsay Bolton.They’ll ride to White Harbor. Ramsay we are coming for you. Bastardbowl one step close…The Iron Islands:Here Euron Greyjoy wins the Kingsmoot, much to the chagrin of his niece and nephew Yara and Theon. Euron is crazy, but he promises his people glory and riches. He tells them he’ll go to Dany with a fleet and together with the Mother of Dragons they’ll rule the world.So Yara and Theon escape while Euron is being drowned (yeah, in most places it’s “crowned” but they heard it wrong in the Iron Islands and so the rhyme stuck.) Not only do they escape, they take a bunch of ships with them. At least they had allies.Where will they sail? Like Dorne and various other regions, this is a fairly huge departure from the books.We’ll fly to the other side of the continent and out across the narrow sea, for now. To…Braavos:Here Arya Stark is still training, still getting the living daylights beat out of her by the older girl, still on track to become a Faceless Man (Girl?) (A girl has no face!)Finally, Arya’s story went somewhere. Tasked with assassinating an actress, Arya is sent by Jaqen H’ghar to a play. It’s not just any play either. It’s the story of King Robert’s death, and the beheading of Eddard Stark.Credit: HBOI’m not sure at this point what she’ll end up becoming, but I’m still betting against her going all the way Faceless. I said it in my predictions video and I’ll say it again: Arya Stark is a Stark first and foremost. She can’t forget or let go of the travesties visited upon her and her family.Vaes Dothrak:We won’t linger long. Just long enough to watch as Jorah Mormont confesses both his love for Dany and his sickness, the Grey Scale. Perhaps the two are not so different for the aging knight. Both will kill him eventually.It’s a touching moment, though nowhere near so powerful as Hodor’s sacrifice later on. I’m glad it came before that actually, as it would have been entirely overshadowed.Still, it was good to see Jorah speak plainly to his queen of his infatuation and devotion. It was good to see her forgive him at last. After all, he only agreed to spy on her before he knew her, before he loved her. Eventually he stopped. Everyone deserves redemption, and Jorah more than most.Dany told him, “Well, I command you to find the cure, wherever it is in this world. I command you to heal yourself and then return to me. When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side.”So Jorah goes on one very much impossible quest. Perhaps he meets his family up in the North will side with Jon and Sansa, too.Credit: HBOMeereenIn Meereen, Tyrion is still doing what he does best: Talking and drinking and knowing things. His plan, now that a tenuous peace has been achieved, is to get the propaganda machine’s wheels spinning. So naturally he turns to the church.The High Priestess of the Lord of Light meets with Tyrion and Varys and agrees to help them, since Dany is obviously the Chosen One (just like Stannis, Varys points out; and just like Jon Snow, we think to ourselves.)Varys is, interestingly, pretty hostile about “fanatics.” He confronts the priestess about Stannis, mucking up Tyrion’s diplomatic efforts with a pretty hostile challenge to the woman. Perhaps he takes issue with her desire to use the dragons to burn “thousands” of unbelievers. Tyrion does also, though only jokingly. Varys seems truly disturbed by the woman.He’s more disturbed when he discovers that she knows his story, his deepest secrets, the tale of his loss of manhood at the hands of his master. I don’t think I’ve ever seen Varys so off his game and unsettled. I’m not sure how to feel about it, to be honest. In the books, Varys isn’t anywhere near Meereen, so I’m still getting used to him being here.VerdictIt’s interesting how certain parts of the show are so like the books while others are so different. I don’t know what happens with Bran beyond the Wall.Then, in other areas the show seems so entirely and utterly divorced from Martin’s work. Sansa in Castle Black? Varys in Meereen? Doran Martell in the grave? It’s strange.Strange but okay. I like that the show and the books have diverged so vastly, because now I can still look forward to a different story in the books. I’m actually hoping, however, that the Hodor story is the same in the books as it was on TV, because that moment was just so great.Hodor is one of the few characters on this show who got to exhibit unadulterated joy. He was never weighed down by politics, family drama and intrigue. No matter which characters or houses you happen to favor, everybody was on Team Hodor. Kudos to Kristian Nairn, who managed to turn a single-word performance into such a memorable character. He will be missed. Hodor. Hodor.. Hodor…This was the best episode of Season 6 so far, and one of the best I’ve seen of the entire show. Hodor has been utterly transformed for me, and we’ve learned something big and important about the origin of the White Walkers. All told, a brilliant hour of television and I can’t wait for next week. We have five episodes left. I wish we had ten.Update: source link.What did you think?Thanks for A2A Mohit Chawla.
s06e05	See, without Cersei and Jaime dragging it down with their boringness, I enjoy this show a lot more. Now if we can only cut out Dany, Jorah, Tyrion and Varys, we’ll have a cracking show.This was probably the first episode in this series’ history that I as a long time book fan literally stood up with my jaw dropped at what was happening on the screen. So many theories confirmed; so many other theories quashed in this episode. Previously bits from the show that hadn’t featured in the books were either so obvious(Daenerys) or just not going to happen that way in the books(anything with Sansa or Brienne…) But the Bran scene had me floored.A lot of scenes of people asserting good old fashioned dominance: Sansa dominates Littlefinger; The Waif dominates Arya; The Red Priestess dominates Varys; Euron Greyjoy dominates Yara and Theon; Bran dominates Hodor;The North—some good solid soap opera going on between Sansa and Littlefinger. Littlefinger is still manipulating Sansa. People all over the internet are bitching about Sansa lying to Jon: these are the same people who bitch about her being so honest to everybody. I think holding her cards close to her chest is a good thing; and I’m not so sure she should trust Littlefinger with his men. I mean, from her point of view. We saw what happened the last time Littlefinger offered to help someone(Ned.) But what confuses me, is why is Melisandre at that table? I mean, isn’t Melisandre all about fighting the White Walkers? Isn’t that her MAIN THING? And suddenly she’s all just involved in the council meeting to take Winterfell? This show needs to think things through a little bit. I have a sour taste in my mouth about Brienne and Tormund Chocolate Stealer because my HILARIOUS post about him last week was flagged for being a joke answer, even though it wasn’t really a joke, it was just funny. Lord Commander Edd Tollett. ‘Don’t Let the WAll Fall Down while I’m gone.” Jon says.Gee, I wonder what that was foreshadowing? Hamfisted Weiss and Benioff strike again.Braavos—impressive as it is and despite the fact that it works cinematically, you have to wonder what the whole beat Arya training is good for? I understand it’s some brainwashing technique, but it seems to be an end to itself. When Arya can’t hit the Waif, she’s failed: as if the whole thing is to hit the waif. By not hitting the waif, she proves that she’s not ‘one of them.’ Yet, if she hit the waif, wouldn’t that prove that the waif wasn’t one of them? And anyway, what do all these quarterstaff shenanigans have to do with being a Faceless Man? How often are Faceless Men going to have to deal with people coming at them and fighting like that? It’s like the show has combined water dancing of the books with, er, Faceless Manning. It’s funny how the show boils thing down to sheer obviousness: Kill this innocent person or we’ll kill you.But the play…though the circumstances are slightly different, the play(based on a play from the Mercy chapter from the yet-to-be-released Winds of Winter…I mean THIS is George RR Martin. You can really tell that this is the product of a great mind: the play is so multi-layered: it comments on nature of drama and it’s distortion of events for the sake of story, as good king Joffrey is betrayed by the evil Tyrion and Stark’s head is cut off; it works as history: medieval drama really was that silly; it works as we see the affect on poor Arya at the story being told and how it ‘reminds’ her of who she is—so, so sad. And it’s funny as hell. So when Arya says she’s made her decision at the end, I think it’s clear: she’s out of there! On the other handd, was that Richardd E Grant as one of the actors? I can’t imagine that he would have such a small role in this show: I assume he’ll be back.Daenerys—”find a cure and then come back. I’ll need you in Westeros.” Ah, see? This is just shit. I mean pure, unadulterated, unpasteurized, grade A, unfiltered, free-range, grass-fed, non-biodegradable nuclear SHIT. I can buy Dany walking unburnt through the fire. No problem. But Jorah just merrily riding off to cure an incurable disease? Puh-lease. Obviously, Benioff and Weiss screwed up by giving Greyscale to Jorah and now they have to backpedal furiously because ‘they need him’ with Dany for whatever the plot demands. Stupid.The Iron Islands—Yara is, like, queen of the Game of Thrones montage, isn’t she? I liked the King’s Moot scene. Show Euron has all the spookiness and freakiness and madness shaved off him. Why is the show so afraid to get freaky? But it does what it does and I thought it worked well. Some other reviewer remarked about the whole kinslaying taboo having gone out the window. I could write alot about how the show boils everything down to life and death. I don’t like it, but the show does, so I think that Euron’s gleeful admission of murdering his brother and his wishes to murder Theon and Yara make sense within the confines of the show.I totally called that Theon would be taking Victarion’s place. I didn’t call Yara doing it.By the way, Theon’s accent totally changed. That thick Yorkshire accent he’s been doing…it was mostly gone. I don’t like that.Meereen: Speaking of stupid, I thought Tyrion was all-good, all-knowing? I can’t think that his spreading the News of Daenerys’ godhood is all that good idea. And the show hates religioun with a passion. So working with the Red Priestess is going to backfire. Nice face acting from Conleth Hill, seriously. I bought his horror and fear. But, where exactly is it going? Are the Red Priests going to screw things up for the fragile peace, or…ooh, yeah. I forgot. I don’t care.Bran: WOW. So this is what it’s like for show-only watchers. A dozen fan-theories confirmed or destroyed in a few scenes.Children of the Forest made the White Walkers to defend themselves from humans!! Someone on reddit pointed out a throwaway line from A Storm of Swords: “Was it really an Other you killed, Sam, or just a child’s snow knight?” Grrm strikes again!White Walkers/Others are NOT bothered by fire. Fire does NOT destroy them. Repeat Fire does not destroy them. Only the wights.Hodor. That ‘hold the door’ theory was always one of the funniest and most pointless bits of tinfoil I’ve ever read. And yet…apparently… Laughing my a off.No Tower of Joy revelation, but don’t worry, we’re getting it.I have to wonder about Summer dying. Do you all think that it happens that way in the books? I tend to think Summer will survive that episode in the books, and they killed him off because of budget and shock value. But Hodor’s death felt all too book-like, for me: effectively because Hodor gives his life for Bran, but because Bran wargs him and ruins his mind. There is no way that Benioff and Weiss came up with that idea: that’s GRRM all the way.. And which way were they heading? North or South? I think something has to happen at the standing stones, which I think is where the White Walkers took the Craster’s baby in Season 4, right?I don’t know if it was just the spoiler power of the last scene or the lack of Jaime and Cersei’s boring boringness or what, but I enjoyed this episode more than most.
s06e05	Pretty good.(Spoilers obviously. Pretty nasty ones. Go back if you haven’t seen it already.)“What if I don’t want to remain when you are gone?” - Bran, Dance with Dragons.Beyond the NorthWe finally have major answers. We know that the children of the forest, never always sung the song of the earth. They spoke the song of the dead for their own good. Their self-interests have finally lead to a full-stop of their tribe.The scene where Meera is waking up Bran is so similar to the prologue of Dance with Dragons, wherein Varamyr is being woken up violently by Thistle.We then have Meera feeling the cold and running out to witness the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Camera zooms in on the Night’s King and then on to Meera:He sees me.It was established early on that ripples created by the present can be felt, and that now it can certainly have influence over the past. This truly doesn’t sow any fruitful seeds, though. One such as that of Hodor. Isaac does a great job in projecting those emotions just by the use of his eyes. Works all the time. “I told you so” moments. Also, the tinfoils were partly right about Bran being a villain. The climax was a tragic poetry, poignantly constructed and delivered. Since this is coming straight from Martin, the show hasn’t diverged on this bit. Thank god.Hodor’s loss was truly fitting to the story. He has been Stark loyalist right from the birth. I think it is one of the very few advantages that the show medium enjoys: flashbacks. It’s definitely visually stunning which perfectly enables them to explore Hodor’s tragedy in his last, life-saving moments. I was more proud than sad somehow, as I always thought that when time comes Hodor must be sacrificed for good.Well “The Bear and the Maiden Fair” tickling scenes are truly a gem. Bummer that our Maiden has to part ways. Sansa! That brings up the legendary Blackfish. The last we know of him was he escaped the red wedding and now he has an army!?There were other little moments I thoroughly enjoyed as well: Sansa’s sisterly offering to Jon, Edd, Varys’ past, and goodbye Jorah the Andal for good. I think Jorah’s path will meet Euron or whosoever is going to eastwards to woo our Dragon lady.Kinvara. Kinvara. Ania Bukstein was meant to play this part. Her eyes ruined the spider’s web. Wonder where the show writers are going with this? Is Quaithe coming back too this season?We are left to ponder over who’s side we really want to be.The reason why obsidian can kill the WW because that’s their core. They seem to be a lot powerful.The landscapes shots were carefully fitted with the character’s depth. The colors in scene where Dany and the Co. have a chat were spot on too. This show gets a A for offering small moments and balancing the main story solidly.Hold the Door is possibly the new Always, possibly.Side Note: Coincidentally Jack Bender (Sopranos, Carnivàle, Under the Dome) earlier directed a movie called Rewind which is as the name suggest is based on time travel. The director clearly nailed the tragiheroic final moments of Hodor.
s06e05	Liked this episode thanks to a tense and brilliant ending. It washed away all the sins which show committed on Ironborn in this episode, which irked me despite the fact that I’ve stopped comparing the show to books.****Obvious Spoilers follows****Talking about the top 3 exciting scenes/moments of the episode:Big reveal about the origins of Others. Children of the forest created something which in the end even they couldn’t control, classic case of Frankenstein's monster. Bloodraven, children of forest, Summer (poor Summer), and Hodor (poor poor Hodor) sacrificed themselves in an intense climax to the episode when the Night King came calling for the Bran. Another highly unlikely and far out theory of “Hold the Door = Hodor” came true, though partially, in an highly emotional end to the episode. Poor Hodor, he never had a choice in how his life was going to be shaped just so that he could hold the door years later. And note to D&D - STOP KILLING DIREWOLVES!!!!Sansa taking down Littlefinger. Her decision to make him say the deeds which Ramsay had done to her was chilling. Littlefinger had the decency to look ashamed, though for a master manipulator like him that would have come easy. I still maintain that the bastard knew everything about The Bastard and threw Sansa to the wolves (ironic pun). On the other hand, Sansa knitting Direwolf for herself and Jon was a cute momentWaif’s punches - 10/10. Arya should plan on befriending her somehow and then when the time comes leave Braavos with her. Waif will definitely come handy in many a tight spots. A little reveal about the origins of First Faceless Man and how he brought the gift to slaves. Maybe in coming episode, show will give us the canon version of DoomContinuing a bit more on Arya scenes. The show did a interesting take in replacing Petyr with Tyrion in the play which was being enacted in the scene of betraying Ned. Not just replaced but shown in a highly negative light when after betraying Ned he forcefully married Sansa. Foreshadowing for a conflict between Arya and Tyrion?? Faceless men don’t like dragons and they can give the contract to Arya to kill Tyrion who is helping Dany the mother of Dragons. Seems plausible.Sansa was shown in charge in scenes of planning their strategy against Boltons but there was also some naivety. She seems too trusting and banking on the “North remembers”. Given the harsh realities she has faced in past couple of years she should be skeptical of anything like this. Also how the armies in Riverrun will help them in North if she is not ready to take help from Petyr who is stationed at Moat Cailin.Now to talk about Kingsmoot. Even if I like to keep books out of my mind while watching show, somethings are just unacceptable. Kinslaying is the biggest crime and a Kinslayer is accursed in eyes of Gods and shunned by his fellow men. This is also true for Ironborn. This makes the decision of show to let Euron proudly accept that he killed his brother and King (adding Kingslaying to the list) strange and reduced Ironborn to lowly pirates who don’t care about any of these things. I’m not fan of Ironborn, but this stooped them down even more.Yara and Theon were smart enough to bail out from Kingsmoot as soon as possible with all the good ships that they can manage. Good on them, as Euron first item in his to-do list was to finish off his niece and nephew. And then the great leader Euron ordered his minions to “chop down all trees and make me a fleet”. Well they better make these ships in next couple of episodes if the Ironborn story is going to progress at all. Good luck ya poor ‘xcuse of pirates!!!One perfunctory line mention for Vaes Dothrak - Dany is all teared up about poor Jorah the Andal and commands him to find a cure and come back.Moving on, in Meereen, another red priestess is in play now. Fanaticism and highly inflated ego is a very dangerous combination, so Kinvara + Dany can spell out bad news for everyone in near future. The stage seems set for Kinvara vs Melisandre (or Dany vs Jon). Good on Varys, though, to call out Kinvara on the questions that all the viewers were thinking.
s06e05	Oh, my word: it was fantastic!It makes it very hard to be flippant: the ending was extraordinary. Layers upon layers. The ‘magic’ stuff has been quite frustrating for me so far because (unlike the books) there seems no cost to it. This episode showed an incalculable cost: a person’s mind.Previously, I was going toCompare the Night’s King to Jack Frost, the naughty Goblin, from the popular book series for young children, Rainbow Magic. Not any more.Nor am I going to mention Bloodraven with his face like a disappointed iron.I take it back, Bloodraven: you were right to be a massive spoil-sport, with your ‘we must leave this interesting flashback and return to the tree-cave, where we will be dank and bored for all eternity whilst mushrooms grow out of our faces.’Bloodraven, you were right. Mushroom faces would be wonderful right now.Instead we had:-The Wall: Ding, dong! There’s somebody at the door. If ever someone deserved hot pincers, it’s Baelish.Braavos: Arya needs to kill the (possibly) Nice Lady because it’s already been paid for. The corpse is presumably some kind of receipt and the potential ‘cooling-off’ period doesn’t bear thinking about.Bran: Bran touches something he shouldn’t. There were no warning signs around it and he probably has a claim: if a person can get compensation for a cup of coffee being hot, then the payout for entering a vision where the Night’s King touches your arm, giving him access all areas to your tree cave in the future, should be astronomical.Iron Islands: Yara is looking odds on to be Queen until Euron rocks up to remind the Ironborn that he has a knob and she doesn’t. He cannot resist a ‘Theon hasn’t got a knob’ put-down, but how he knows that Theon hasn’t got a knob is anyone’s guess.Euron gets the job because he has a knob, though the Ironborn do noti) check he’s got a knobii) recall that they also have knobs making them equally qualified, oriii) consider that it’s not a great way to choose a leader.Vaes Dothrak: Dany commands Jorah to find a cure for greyscale and then return to her. Jorah goes off to do so. Daario looks at them both like they’re stupid (which they are).Meereen: Tyrion decides to throw some religious fanaticism into the murder soup that is Meereen. If there’s one thing guaranteed to cement a fragile peace, it’s religious fanaticism (-not): Varys looks at Tyrion like Daario looked at Dumb and Dumber in the previous paragraph.The tree cave:I drew a diagram: I’m not sure it helps.A bit like quantum mechanics, I kind of understood it at the time, but now I could no more explain it than I could resurrect Jon Snow. It is below.The last five minutes with Bran and Hodor were heartbreaking. The actor who plays Bran is extraordinary: he barely moves, and I couldn’t even identify the expressions on his face, but it was all there and I felt it all with him. I don’t think I’ve ever been left stunned like that by a film or a TV show.
s06e05	*SPOILER ALERT*This is not actually a review, this is just a theory stitched from the implications, spoilers and others fan theories which are already stated till season 6 episode 5.I am wondering what if all the spoilers and fan theories come true?1) Fan theory about Meera Reed being the long lost twin sister of Jon Snow.2) Fan theory about John riding an ice dragon.3) Also spoiler about Arya striking 3 names off her list this season.Sophie Turner turns up the HYPE (SPOILERS EVERYTHING)4) The implication from "The Door" episode that the White Walkers can now break the wall if Bran crosses the wall with the Knight King's mark on his hand.5) The show makers announced that this season is about Homecoming.So these combine to form this final theory:Bran reaches Castle Black with Meera (She should be alive for him to reach). Following Bran and his mark, the Knight's king marches to the wall with his army.Jon and Sansa will be in the Castle Black gathering the army to attack Boltons and take over Winterfell.If Arya strikes off 3 names off her list this season, I am guessing one of them should be Melisandre. She has to reach the Castle Black to kill her. So in the same time , she may reach Castle Black.If the theory about Meera being long lost twin sister of John is true, that makes her half-Strak and Winterfell is her home.So all Starks are united now. Jon, Bran, Sansa and Meera. They rescue Rickon together in Winterfell. Homecoming FTW.Now we have 4 people to ride the dragons (Daenerys, John, Tyrion and Meera) and 3 Dragons. It would be perfect if John wakes up the ice dragon trapped inside the wall. 4 Dragons and 4 people of that ambition can conquer anything. If this happens, there is no perfect time than this to be alive.PS: This is just a theory. There may be many loop holes in this. Comment if you find any. Everything has to fit in the timeline though.
s06e05	To be frank this episode somewhat turned to a time travel science fiction movie in the end.I still don’t get why the 3 eyed raven took bran back in time to winterfell when he knew white walkers were coming for him. Did he do it just to make bran realize what turned Willis into HODOR? and what made willis cry “hold the door(hodor)” when he is technically in the past at that time. Did bran warg into willis but then how hodor was under his control at the present or “Warging doesn’t follow rules of time”.Ahhh!! Its confusing.It popped up lots of questions about bran’s future and I know dozens of fan theories will arise until next week but still bran’s character has taken a very deeper turn and he suddenly is gaining more and more importance as a character. Every one else starts to look petty infront of him.The demise of so many major characters in the same episode makes me sad. Children of the forest are technically all gone, 3 eyed raven gone, HODOR gone :’( , Summer gone :’( :’(. What’s now left of Bran and company if only Bran and Meera.What did the 3 eyed raven meant when he said it’s time for you to become me. This is the one thing that I am dying to watch in the further episodes.Overall the episode was good and confusing for the end bit,important characters died but well then its Game of thrones. Killing characters after making audience love them is its USP.
s06e05	(Show Spoilers) Despite the very unexpected explanation of the Others/White Walkers, I thought this was a good episode.Sansa: The episode begins with Sansa working on clothes, and receiving a message to go to Mole Town. The expected confrontation with Littlefinger was well done: Sansa makes it clear that she suffered at the hands of Ramsay. Yet Littlefinger still finds himself in control again, first with his insistence that he never knew what Ramsay was. (Do you believe him?) Then he asks to speak, giving him a chance to dominate the conversation by telling Sansa that the Blackfish has somehow taken back Riverrun. She has more allies in her war against the Boltons. Sansa does not share this information with Jon, sending a wary Brienne to negotiate terms in the South. Now we may have yet another reason for Jaime to go to Riverrun, and perhaps participate in the cause of the Starks, as I cannot see him defending Ramsay, who thankfully is a renegade against the Lannisters. This plot development makes the Battle of the Bastards into a larger Westeros cause.Jon Snow: Sansa gives him a direwolf outfit, so Jon has been presented with clothes and free to leave the Night’s Watch to aide the Stark cause. (I couldn’t resist the Harry Potter joke when I saw the scene.) We don’t get much of Jon, but what we get is important, as he will be doing politics to gain support for his battle against Ramsay. I predict he will get House Mormont and House Cerwyn, with House Hornwood as undecided. Sansa made a good argument for the Karstarks returning to the Stark fold, which Davos dismissed. We heard “the North remembers” a lot in this section, which may be the show’s way of acknowledging the book’s Northern conspiracy without developing it into the plot itself.Arya: A girl has been given a second chance. It is a hard test for Ayra, as she has to watch an outdoor play that ridicules her father’s death and shows the grief of her sister. Will Ayra kill the actress that she has been ordered to assassinate? Will she remember who she is, and decide to go to Westeros to avenge her father’s death? The show leaves us with these questions.Daenarys and Meereen: She left her superhero cape with the horses, so she is back as good old Dany, talking to Jorah and ordering him to heal himself from greyscale. After dispatching all the Khals of the Dothraki into the flames, I suppose it isn’t too much to ask. It was a nice moment, and knowing Jorah, he will obey, and everyone with greyscale will start worshipping Daenarys Targaryen too. We also got another Red Priestess, who has sworn that Dany is the prince who is promised. Thank goodness for Varys—he mentioned Stannis Baratheon and the “been there, done that” speech. This priestess knows something about Varys and his mutilation, so R’hllor is clearly invested in every link. I couldn’t help but wonder about R’hllor: the god raised Jon from the dead through one priestess, while another one is on Team Daenarys. It made me think of how both teams pray to God to win the Superbowl. However, it is significant that R’hllor is clearly a player in the affairs of Westeros, even though so few in Westeros believe in that god.Ironborn: Is it me or is show Euron unimpressive? Why would anyone choose him over Yara? But I live in a country that may nominate Donald Trump to run for president, so I have no right to judge the Ironborn. Theon kept his word, insisting that his sister should be the first Queen of the Ironborn, and Yara certainly did her best to convince them. Euron introduces the Daenarys connection, while he apologized for not killing Balon Greyjoy sooner. I think the story will still be good, as Yara and Theon have taken ships, while Euron (no eyepatch) has ordered everyone to build more. I don’t know where Theon and Yara will go, but it won’t be helpful to Euron, He will probably be going to Slaver’s Bay.Bran,Hodor, and The White Walkers: I saved this for last, as this was the Hardhome battle for episode 5. We find out that the Children of The Forest created the White Walkers to defend themselves against “Men”. (Well, if we need to get technical, it would have been the First Men, and I bet they are sorry now, as they made peace with them. Was that First Man a Stark tied up against the tree?) Bran was marked by the Night King (again, this suggests that he is a Stark to me), and Bloodraven warns him that he will come to find him. We find out how Hodor got his name, plus we learn that visions do affect the past. Hodor means “hold the door”, which Hodor does to save Bran while Bran in a vision is looking at the young Wylis who has a seizure precisely when the present Hodor is defending Bran against the army of the dead. It is heartbreaking. We also see more death to important characters. This episode shows that Bran must live at all costs, and the costs were high. The show is playing a risky game with the Stark direwolves, and I really need to think about why they are choosing this path.A lot of questions remain—the fate of Hodor, the connections of the Red God, Littlefinger’s game, the show’s risky gamble with the direwolves, who will support Jon Snow, why did the White Walkers go rogue after the Children created them?. We shall see.
s06e05	Disclaimer: I am only going to talk of the elephant in the room. The rest of the episode was good but really nothing special in my humble opinion. Apart from you know what, the best takeaways I had from this episode were:1)So Jorah is going on a lone wolf sort of a quest. I think this is a fascinating turn of events and can take the character to much darker, Wolverine-sque territories. We should finally get to see the real Jorah.2)Arya’s arc is unfortunately, still quite bland. Lets hope she gets to kill someone by the end of the season. And no, I don’t think she is returning to Westeros anytime soon.3)From the Northern arc, the Brienne and Tormund moment was fantastic, the rest was just setup for Bastard bowl. I am having a premonition Littlefinger may pull off a major backstab by the end of the season.Now that that’s over, lets talk of what’s breaking the Internet right now, and more importnantly, what implications does it have for the entire ASoIaF fandom.OBVIOUS Spoilers follow:So, we finally get to know why Hodor is well, Hodor, one of the apparently trivial, yet nevertheless most intriguing mysteries plaguing us since S1. I won’t waste time describing exactly how this happens, but here’s what I believe are its repercussions.First of all, lets be clear about how time travel in GoT really works. As many others have already mentioned, its based on a causal loop model. I feel there are two necessary points regarding this:1)To answer another long standing fan query, yes, Bran can and does change the past. The limit of his abilities are not presently clear. E.g: We don’t know if Bran can directly interact with the past, like whether Ned Stark can hear him when he calls out. What we do know, however, is that Bran can warg into anybody’s past versions, and thus indirectly affect the timeline.2)The timeline we are watching is one that has already been tampered with by future Bran. E.g: Its not like say X-Men:Days of Future Past or Back to the Future where a character goes back in time and his actions there change the present. No, to give a Back to the Future analogy, we are watching the timeline after it has been modified by Marty, and it is slowly being revealed how the modification takes place.What this means of course, is that now we have to see the entire series in a different light. “Hodor” will hardly be the only time Bran uses his abilities, and what this implies is that literally any of the major events so far may have been orchestrated by Bran.And I don’t have it to spell it out from here. “Hold the Door” doesn’t hold the door, but unlocks one to a Pandora’s Box of wild fan theories. GoT has finally let its rabid fandom off its leash. We now have a license to go ballistic with our imagination, and justify everything with Time Travel, the mother of all deus ex machinas.But rationally speaking, there are 3 possibilities I can think of which Bran influences:1)Jaime pushes Bran out the window: Arguably the event which started it all (it directly lead to Tyrion’s capture which indirectly led to the War of the Five Kings). But more significantly, it set Bran on the path towards Bloodraven and becoming a Greenseer, which had and will have a far reaching impact on the overall plot. So its quite possible Bran time travelled, warged into Jaime, and pushed his past self out the window, to set this crucial chain of events into motion.On a side note if this is really true, Jaime goes from a morally ambiguous anti-hero to a genuinely decent guy who, for all his flaws, would never hurt a child. I don’t think GRRM would go down this route, it makes Jaime, hands down, the coolest character in the entire series!2)Something to do with Benjen: Again I have a hunch Benjen’s fate will be revealed by Bran later this season, and who knows, he might even be responsible for Benjen going underground for all this time. Though to what purpose is of course, anybody’s guess.3)The Mad King:This is more tinfoil, but The Mad King also dies uttering the same words over and over “Burn them all”. The resemblance to Hodor seems uncanny. Bran might have warged into Aerys, or even killed Aerys by warging into Jaime, who knows, either way it will be cool as fuck.P.S: This episode also properly introduced a cult favourite from the books, Euron Greyjoy. And I must say I am largely disappointed. This character had the potential to be the next Khal Drogo, Oberyn Martell or Sandor Clegane. I don’t know whether its the writing( which frankly seems a bit weak this season ) or the acting, but Euron clearly lacks the bite and a certain edge which made the likes of Oberyn or the Hound such fan favourites. Show Euron gives the impression of a pompous noble, who will get killed any moment now, rather than a badass player of the Game, which book Euron is. And I virtually rolled my eyes at the thought of show Euron seducing Daenerys, I found the portrayal that bad, but then again its only my opinion.Overall, one of GoT’s better episodes, though I would say lacked in overall consistency, and the usually sharp writing of GoT. Still plenty of positives, and nicely sets up the rest of the season.
s06e05	Spoiler free review: Fuck you, D&D.Spoilers:The good:Sansa. While she’s still making missteps, she’s also learning who not to trust. Refusing Littlefinger’s help is extremely smart. While in the short term, it does seem like the most sensible thing to do, she also knows well enough that Littlefinger’s help will come at a price.While it’s far less subtle in the books, the intrigue between the Lannisters and the Tyrells is starting to go somewhere. I hope Oleana Tyrell realises that something smells fishy with Cersi’s story. It’s going to be so much less interesting if she thinks everything is on the level.It looks like the Iron Islands story might be going somewhere.The bad:Arya’s story. Arya gets the shit beat out of her, Jaquen asks her things, Arya gives the answers she thinks he wants. Wash, rinse, repeat. Are they actually training her or just beating her up and playing mind games? I’m annoyed that I’m unsure about whether this is bad writing, or if they are actually trying to hint that something’s up with how Jaquen and the Waif are treating Arya.The fuck you:Sure, kill another direwolf. I guess they mean as much as oaths mean in this world (as opposed to GRR’s world). Don’t bother making it meaningful or anything. CGI is expensive afterall.Pulling a Buffy’s mom with Hodor. Seriously, fuck you D&D. You did not have the skill to pull off whatever GRR planned there, and you damn well knew it. The way it’s written, there’s no reason for him to die except to get us to cry.Look, I’m fine with characters I like dying. It makes for a good story and it’s not out of place in this world. But seriously, Hodor died just because Bloodraven…what? Didn’t like him? Felt like shattering an innocent boy’s mind before needlessly making him die? For the lulz?Because, if Bloodraven didn’t feel the need to wander around in Winterfell past, Bran could have warged Hodor from the present and not hurt him. Oh, but then Hodor wouldn’t be Hodor. Even better, then Bran could have told Wyllis, “Hey, pick me up, we need to go NOW!” and off they would have ran.And maybe Hodor/Wyllis still died that day, but:a). It would have been his choice.b). At least he’d have not lived most of his life with a severe mental impairment.If the argument is that Wyllis wouldn’t have been the faithful companion Hodor was, how would Bloodraven have known? He’s not omnicient. If he was, he’d have given them a few hours warning that the White Walkers were on the way (he’d have known, of course). Plus, really, Hodor/Wyllis the only one in Westeros who would have helped? Jojen has greendreams which sent him to Bran. He knew it was his job to get him to the Children of the Forest. There’s really nobody that either Bran or the Reed’s knew who could have leant a back?There were ways to make Hodor’s death both inevitable and meaningful. What’s wrong with Bran figuring out there’s something wrong with Bloodraven’s little trip to the past while the White Walkers are outside the cave? What if it’s Bran’s arguing with Bloodraven that makes him warging Hodor from the past inevitable? What if it was Hodor in the present that realised he needed to hold the door, and he sends the message to himself?And I guess you can warg someone from the past for a certain amount of time before you break their brain? It was quite awhile after Bran warged Hodor that Hodor was told to “hold the door”.Pointless. D&D just wanted to steal GRR’s thunder.
s06e05	Hackneyed…but chock full of spoilers.Sansa is all grown up now. They even flew Baelish about 700 miles through the winter and raiders, etc, just so he could be told off by her. I guess he’ll just sneak on down to Moat Caillin again to hang out with Jon Snow’s mom. Or maybe she came up north too. It should be a pretty quick trip if you don’t leave the highway and only have a toilet break every 3 hours. It’s great, though, she’s sassy, making clothes, and all the while Jon Snow is moping around the castle telling everyone, “Hey, don’t ask me. I’m not in charge any more,” and not inviting the woman who resurrected him to his meetings. Thank goodness for Brienne and Tormund, who are the comic relief in Westeroi’s version of ‘Taming of the Shrew’.Speaking of theater, I did enjoy the show they put on in Braavos. It was a very welcome break from the Rocky Training Montage. There were boobs and, finally, a penis. Yes, they are taking the fan input seriously now. Actually, the theater piece was quite good, but I have to say it expects a lot from the Braavosi audience’s knowledge of the court politics in Westeros. I would have written it with far more errors and character mixups, unless, bear with me and my theories, Varys has a sideline as a bard. Evidence 1: He tells Tyrion that he was part of a mummers troupe. Evidence 2: Varys has terrific connections in Braavos and could totally produce the play. Evidence 3: the guy is always dressing up and acting out different characters, especially in the book. He knows talent when he sees it. He’ll be having Briennea playing the Sansa and Sansa playing Cersei, just as soon as Arya’s done chasing chickens around the yard and not bruising despite multiple blows to the head and ‘gives the gift of the Faceless God’ to the two current actresses.Many people are excited about the Hodor revelation. I was not. It felt lame and small. When I heard D&D talking about it after the show, and how flabbergasted they were when it was revealed, I was imagining their real reaction. “Really? He holds a door and dies? Oh yeah, don’t worry, we won’t change that. Couldn’t top that.” Maybe that’s why they’ve basically killed off Bran and Meera, and had the super-cheesy grenade self-sacrifice trope, but with elves! They are that upset. With a dash out the back door from a cave in a hill in a mountain valley that was surrounded by wights and WW’s in the middle of a snow storm (WW home field advantage terrain, not Bran’s), dragging a sledge, it seems like there should be no chance of survival. Bran even has a spider-tracer on him. Should wrap that up 5 minutes into the next episode. There just wasn’t time this week.Couldn’t have the wights trying to break through the torch-lit door catch fire and burn the place to the ground with the wight army inside as a setback for the WW’s, nor have Hodor escape and explain how he felt to Bran about the guy messing him up since he was a kid and warging into him when he wanted to see over everyone’s head. And that’s just simple stuff I was thinking as I watched it. Nope. The ‘Hold the door’ explanation was painful enough that D&D decided just to end this storyline and quickly deal with the ‘Here, this is how the Others were made. OK. It’s done now. We now have the three classic monsters (Vampires, golems, werewolves) + dragons. We simplified it and made the out-of-control golems also be vampires.’ No need for more buildup. It really feels to me like they are tying up the lose ends as quickly as they can. I guess the dragons are sort of golems, being created by Dany, but they’re also sort of werewolf.The scenes with Dany were more of the same for her. A lot of gazing down at people and acting important. I’m not sure if the ‘I order you to find a cure to your disease, you big lovable lug,’ was meant to illustrate her naivete or just weak writing. I think the only people who managed to stop greyscale were Stannis’s maester & co., and they’re long gone. Regardless, here’s a horse, you’re in the Dothraki foothills far from anyone who won’t just kill you for having greyscale. Good luck, old friend. OK, yes, the lamb people will cure him. They seem nice.So, what else? Ah-yes, the Iron Born. Many besides me have talked about the fickle crowd. I’ll cheer for anyone…when do we get to go reaving again! Arrr! Well, in a nod to the impatience to go reaving, they elect Euron the next king through a resoundingly loud ‘Rhubarb!’ and then a few stick around to watch the ceremony. Theon and Yara know better. They hang back and while everyone is distracted ask “Who wants to go reaving?” 3/4 of the Iron Born go with them, and the rest is history. How else could they steal all the boats? No way it was just their loyal retainers, otherwise they would have still had the loudest ‘Rhubarb!’. I did enjoy the deeply spiritual reawakening of Euron after his baptism. “First things first, lets kill my niece and nephew!”The episode needed more Tyrion. It still had him, but that guy (Peter Dinklage and Tyrion) is great. He manages his lines really well, and does the character better than in the books. I loved the lines in the last couple of episodes, “A wise man once said…” “who said that?” “I did.” and “That’s what I do. I drink and I know things.” He’s practically breaking fourth wall with that. It’s terrific. And do you know what it would be really great for…writing plays with Varys! Evidence 4. I can see the two of them doing a fantastic version of ‘Brush Up On Your Shakespeare’, from “Kiss me Kate!”, a comedy-musical about a production of ‘Taming of the Shrew’, a Shakespeare play that is almost entirely a play-within-a-play, see Christopher Sly. The number of layers on this is off-the charts.
s06e05	[This review contains BIG spoilers from the episode. Seriously, do not read a word until you’ve seen it]………Holy, Holy Hodor. What did we just witness? It’s hard to objectively review “The Door” because like every episode featuring the Night King, this one too ultimately knocks it out of the park. Its failings, of which there are many, simply fall away given the potently visceral reaction that the ending evokes.That being said, let’s attempt to deconstruct everything that happened over the course of this momentous episode.Surefooted SansaSophie Turner is awesome this episode. Her scene with Baelish is powerful, and forces the audience (if not Baelish himself) to contemplate the very real cost of viewing people as property to be traded for personal gain. It doesn’t matter whether Baelish knew Ramsay’s true nature or not; Sansa has paid the price for his actions regardless and will never recover wholly.In a positive sign however, while Sansa is wiser to his act and understandably wary of accepting his help, she has also begun to understand how the game is played. She can see through Baelish’s contrite act and keep him at arm’s length but at the same time, use his offer to get herself a bigger army.Sansa is also increasingly asserting herself as the Stark in the North, and is doing so while keeping her cards close to her chest, trusting not even Jon with the full extent of her plans. The show is hinting at some forthcoming tension between the two (with Baelish alluding to Jon being her half brother and Brienne asking her why she lied) but I can’t yet be sure whether this will materialize, or if it is simply a red herring.Off Broadway in BraavosThe arc with no name finally lived up to its billing, and served up some satisfying scenes. The skit was delectable on its own, hilariously showcasing the “truth” that’s being propagated through the seven kingdoms following Joffrey’s demise. But its real purpose was to demonstrate just how difficult it is going to be for Arya to let go of the past, given the magnitude of injustice she’s had to put up with.On a side note, despite the show’s attempts at lionizing the Sand Snakes, it seems to be Arya’s sparring partner who has quietly established herself as the frontrunner to succeed Brienne as the most awe-inspiring female fighter in Westeros.Missionaries in MeereenAs expected, Tyrion’s expedient plan to contain the violence in Meereen has yielded good short-term results. However, he understands that buying peace isn’t sufficient. If the people are to truly believe in Daenerys’ cause, they have to think of her as a higher being. It is to promulgate her divinity that he recruits the new Red Priestess who promptly impresses even the skeptical Varys with the bag of tricks we’ve seen only too often courtesy Melisandre. Of course, one can’t help but be mistrustful of the priestess’ youth and good looks, given what we now know about the red gem she wears around her neck.Dany maybe immune to fire, but loyalty still melts her heart. Hence, on learning that her guardian angel Jorah has contracted Greyscale, she comes down with a curious case of Graduation Goggles, and orders him to find a cure. I have never liked Jorah, and hope that this offers us at least half a season’s break from him.Logic is drownedThe Iron Islands segment was perhaps the most poorly directed and logic-defying segment of Thrones in ages. Just how fickle is this mob? They change their kingly allegiance with the pace of someone swiping through a list of potential hookups on Tinder.First, they throw their weight behind Yara after a few rallying cries. Then, they’re swayed towards Theon when someone reminds them that Yara ticks all boxes except the most important one — “has a penis” (and conveniently forget that neither does Theon). And just when it appears that Theon has led them yet again to believe in Yara, out comes Uncle Euron. Looking far from regal, Euron admits to regicide and promptly lays out his plan — offer Daenerys their ships and form a coalition, then rule the Seven Kingdoms after her dragons have taken care of the rest. Whatever happened to “we do not sow”?Anyway, let’s chalk up the fact that the crowd immediately embraced someone who had supposedly not even set foot in Pyke in the last several years to another case of Ironborn fickleness. Even then, Euron’s entire claim rests on the fact that he’s got a huge fleet of ships — something that he lets Theon and Yara run away with while he was busy being baptized! And what’s his reaction to this? Build a new fleet!Thankfully, given the time it takes to presumably build battle-ready ships, it seems as though we’re once again prematurely bidding farewell to the Iron Islanders for the season. It is worth noting however that despite the contrived manner in which the show has arrived at it, the alliance between Dany and the Iron Islanders is a natural-enough, mutually beneficial one. Although, given what we know of Daenerys, Euron is likely to end up with the short end of the stick.HBO presents InterstellarSandwiched awkwardly in between Arya and the Iron Islands segment was the huge revelation that the White Walkers were, in fact, created by the Children of the Forest to curb man’s encroachment on their lands. This scene had the potential to be an amazing cliffhanger, and the show really goofed up with its execution here.But boom! From here on out, the episode was pure gold. Not learning from his antics in the pilot, Bran again lets curiosity get the better of him. It turns out that Ned appearing to hear him in a previous flashback was no coincidence, as the Night King not just senses Bran’s presence but actually makes use of it to break past the protective shielding that had till this point been guarding the children and the Three Eyed Raven.I was starting to seriously question the Three Eyed Raven’s priority when faced with an impending White Walker invasion, he takes Bran on yet another pensieve trip. But as it turns out, Bran wasn’t there for sightseeing.In what was Thrones’ most tragic and intricately plotted shock moment till date, time proves to be a closed loop. Bran’s warging into Hodor and Meera’s repeated commands to “hold the door” condemn poor Wyllis of the past to a simple-minded life as Hodor, only for that life to ultimately end at the same moment in the present, as Hodor, in one final heroic act, holds the door long enough for Bran and Meera to escape to safety. Wyllis’ helpless screams set against the heartrending soundtrack had me completely dumbstruck.Hodor’s childlike innocence and the utter lack of control he had over his fate makes this the most saddening death on Thrones for me (Shireen ranks a close second), and I don’t think the visceral effect of that final scene will diminish even after repeated viewings.Rest in peace, Hodor. The world will never see your kind again.
s06e05	Game of Thrones’ “The Door” advances the slowed events of the show by bringing into fruition a key turning point for one of our inactive protagonists.There is more setup than anything, but I thought this was a great look into Bran Stark, someone who was sidelined for the entirety of season 5 and more or less inactive for the rest of the show.SERIOUS SPOILERS AHEAD.The WallIn the past few episodes, one question has been irking my existence: what exactly is Petyr (Littlefinger) Baelish’s end goal? The once calculated mastermind was whittled down to a sniveling brat in his scene with Sansa, as he pleads for her to take him back. It really makes me wonder, did the show botch his character by deviating from the books and jumping the gun with Sansa’s plot or is he still scheming something? I guess we will have to wait to find out.Jon Snow faces the full enormity of his situation: facing the North AND the South. I really enjoyed the debate about the Northerners’ loyalty, as it throws a wrench in the unpredictable outcome of Jon’s plight. Who can he really trust? How can he meet force with force? Jon now enjoys plot armor immunity (ie. why he was brought back from the dead), but he still faces many obstacles in the long winter to come. I will revel at the Bastard Bowl, when Jon finally stops Ramsay cold. The North Fucking Remembers.BraavosA girl is still not ready… Arya’s plot has dragged out for a while now, but at least we got to see a glimpse of her true character through the absurd re-staging of The Battle of the Five Kings. Her discomfort in watching her family’s history be re-written really enforced the fact that she can never truly escape her identity, despite striving to be the cold-hearted killer she is not.PykeTo be perfectly honest, I wish the show had spent more time developing the characters in The Iron Islands rather than painting an extravagantly useless subplot in Dorne. The time that the creators spent circle jerking the Sand Snakes and ultimately killing off potentially more important members of the Martells could have been re-appropriated toward the established rotten family dynamic of the Ironborn.Yara (Asha) Greyjoy is one of the few female characters who is unrestricted by the patriarchy of Westeros, and faces an interesting struggle because diplomacy is not her strong suit. The events of the Kingsmoot simply moved too fast and viewers weren’t allowed room to breathe. In any event, I am at least satisfied with the younger Greyjoys escape and am intrigued to see how the inner conflict will extend to the rest of Westeros.Vaes DothrakIn the episode of Game of Romance, hot popular teen Danaerys Targaryen wistfully leads on war-torn LORD OF THE FRIENDZONE Jorah Mormont into oblivion, by promising that “you will be by my side” when she conquers Westeros High School. Hunk of junk Daario Naharis watches on.Tragedy.MeereenThe chemistry among the new priestess, Tyrion, and Varys? Weird. That’s all I can really say.Beyond The WallIn a dark turn, Game of Thrones manages to top its sickening deaths of beloved characters by revealing the brutally tragic of Hodor. I was on the edge of my seat while watching this scene. The ice mark on Bran’s hand. The fire bombs of the Children of the Forest. The uncomfortable intercut between the White Walker’s invasion and Bran’s quiet flashback of Winterfell.EXCEPT… IT’S NOT JUST A FLASHBACK. In a few short moments, we learn that the Night King can SEE Bran. We learn that Bran can warg into Hodor while remaining immersed in his vision. But then… Bran is not ready. His unlearnt warging without the Three-Eyed Raven leaves him at an extremely vulnerable place. And suddenly, the flood gates are open.“Hold the door!”This piercing statement jolts through Bran, through years of history, and into past Hodor’s mind. Bran, by warging into present Hodor while still immersed in his vision triggered a violent and heartbreaking stroke onto past Hodor.The strained mumbling of “hold the door” morphs into the word “hodor”, and the full weight of Hodor’s doomed existence comes to light.Hodor spent his entire life serving Bran. He died to save Bran. Yet it was Bran that caused his disability in the first place? That’s a dark, terrifying chain of events. It oddly feels personal to such a minor character in the show.Congratulations, Game of Thrones, you have once again wrenched the delicate longing of happiness from deep within my soul and stripped it of all humanity. I guess that means we’re back!
s06e05	[SPOILERS FROM GoT SEASON 6 EPISODE 5. OBVIOUSLY.]Personally I thought that this was by far the best episode yet, not least because there were highs of excitement, comedy and perhaps most significantly sadness.To look at each segment individually:The WallThe Sansa scene was very powerful. Her enduring anguish and pain at the treatment she received at the hands of Ramsay was chillingly portrayed by Sophie Turner. It’s encouraging that she’s beginning to grow in confidence and strength every episode, as evoked here by the contrition she wrung from Baelish.Baelish is still a fascinatingly complex character and I still don’t know quite what to make of him. We assume that he is an omniscient master of manipulation, but did he truly know how bad Ramsay was? I did get a sense of genuine horror and regret from him; Sansa is after all the only remaining connection to Catelyn, who he did seem to genuinely care for.Did I sense some awkward sexual tension between Sansa and Jon when she was giving him the cloak?Finally, it’s good to see the political action is hotting up. Galvanised by Sansa, the Starks are well on the road to regaining Winterfell and recovering from their fall.BraavosThe fight was pretty standard. The play, however, was exceptional. I don’t know if it was just me, but the Ned Stark character was laugh-out-loud funny, and the weak Joffrey character was also amusing. It also provided an intriguing insight into how news and gossip travels through the GoT universe, with Tyrion being framed as the evil mastermind behind the Lannister rise, and Cersei basically being relegated to “undeveloped wife” role.Basically though, the scene was about showing how Arya, quite aside from being “a girl”, remains very much Arya. The Faceless Men seem to be well aware of this, and it seems only a matter of time before she goes back to Westeros.MeerenI think the best thing about this scene was, having demonstrated last week the deep gulf between the pragmatism of Tyrion and Varys and the idealism of Missandei and Greyworm, we now see that Tyrion and Varys have their own distinctions. Tyrion is diplomatic and something of an opportunist, whilst Varys, as a result of his childhood trauma, is deeply mistrustful.The new Red Priest seems an interesting addition to the cast and seemed to possess some sort of magical or clairvoyant power. I notice that as the show progresses the prevalence of magic increases.Vaes DothrakAs a long-term fan of Jorah (I know I’m in the minority), I found the (albeit short) reconciliation/parting scene deeply moving. I hope he does find a cure, and that he is with Dany until the end.The Iron IslandsFor those who complain about the apparent volatility of the islanders at the Kingsmoot, that is exactly what the Ironborn are like. Much like Sansa, I’m greatly enjoying Theon’s recrudescence of confidence and self-hood, and ’m glad him and Yara got away to hopefully play important roles in the battle to some.Euron was is even more manic, darkly funny and dangerous as in the books, and I love him. I hope there’s much more to come. My only complaint is that there hasn’t been more colouring in of the Iron Islands’ (in the books) vivid cast and culture.Beyond the WallSo here we are. Bloodraven is dead, Hodor is dead, and we finally know how he became Hodor and how the White Walkers were created in a scene that quickly went from terror to pathos.Hodor’s bravery, strength and life-long sacrifice to Bran was one of the most tragic and grief—stricken moments in any of the series, and it’s end was the perfect tribute to a great man.
s06e05	Bran is such an asshole!!! Aaarrrggghhh, I AM SO PISSED WITH THAT ANNOYING KID…Who the fuck asked you to simultaneously warg into the present Hodor’s mind and also be in the past event with the child Wylis present?!!Yes, we know that you are extremely powerful in your mind-magic, but please learn something from Spiderman - “With great power comes great responsibility”You have been nothing but an irritation.Because of you, Jojen died.Because of you, poor Summer died.Because of you, the Three-Eyed Raven died.Because of you, all the Children of the Forest died!Because of you, poor Wylis gets his mind fucked up.Because of you, HODOR dies!! This is unacceptable.Too many casualties, and what have you learnt till now!!?In your year-long classes, didn’t you even come across Haggon’s skinchanging abominations rule?? Please study harder.IT IS UNETHICAL TO WARG INTO A HUMAN’S MIND!!Yet, you motherfuckin asshole, you dont stop warging into poor Hodor. On top of that, you take his present mind and make it interact itself with the past mind? How twisted are you!!?And what is up with your unnecessary curiousity? Who the fuck asked you to roam away into the far North? Who the fuck asked you to check out the Night King’s Army? And who the fuck asked you to get touched by him!!? YOU RUINED EVERYTHING, FOR EVERYONE!!Now, we won’t be shown the R+L=J revelation also anytime soon. You stupid idiotic Bran. I HATE YOU. I will never forgive you for what you have done to my beloved Hodor. Huh.Sansa and JonOh lord Sansa, what the fuck is wrong with you? Why the fuck didn’t you tell Jon that you had a whole Vale Arryn’s Army in your hands!!!? Who the fuck cares what Littlefinger did. HE HAS A HUGE ARMY!!You stupid Sansa.. For your own ego, you turned down an entire Army! Gosh. And on top of that, you had the balls to lie to Jon!!! YOU LIED TO JON!!? Huh.And I see what you did there. Giving Jon that cute overcoat, trying to cajole him, trying to emotionally use him, you conniving little bitch.Poor Jon is so overwhelmed by Family Love, that he didn’t see through it. Bastard na, he was yearning for family for a long time. And this Sansa was just trying to butter him up, by giving hand-made clothes.Sansa trying to manipulate Jon by giving small small gifts is DISGUSTING. Jon, being so stupid and naive is more annoying. Huh.Tormund and BrienneI was rooting so much for the “Bri-mund” relationship!! But, this stupid Sansa had to send her back to the Riverlands to gather the Tully Army and the Blackfish. She leaving Tormund would break my heart. :(I hate Sansa. Brienne atlast found someone who genuinely desires her, and now Sansa is sending her half the world away. Aaarrrggghh!!Other segments were fine. Children of the Forest creating the White Walkers brings the Tony Stark creating Ultron twist. Both Ultron and the NK go rogue. So, yeah, that’s fine.I liked the Ironborn mentality. They say yes and vote to anyone who grants them more wishes. LOL. Much like Indian politics.One says, I shall grant you some land and respect.Other says, I shall bring dragons and conquer the world.Promises. Empty promises.Who will build 1000 ships now? LOL. Yet, you become the King!! This is why I don’t like democracy in a medieval setting. :PWhen there is no wide-spread education or literacy, I feel a benevolent monarchy is the best type of political system.Anyways, I am so pissed off at this episode. It was beautiful. It was bitter. It evoked emotions.Overall, it was bitter-sweet.Asshole GRRM.
s06e05	This episode is all about the Night's king marking on Bran. The marking cancels the magic spells that keep the WW away.Let's talk about Benjen Stark AKA. Coldhands for a moment, he has been beyond the wall for a long time for unknown reasons and we know that benjen has many things in common with the WW, although we're not sure exactly what (some people were thinking he's kind of undead but not so dead ..), now that we understand the marking concept we can only draw the parallel with Benjen's cold hands and I think that it would be safe to assume from here that Benjen's coldhands are WW marks on his hands, which also gives a very good explanation of why he stayed beyond the wall and never crossed it back south, which as we said would cancel the wall's magic. He has possibly spent all this time escaping the WW and fooling them around, which could also explain why they have been roaming lately whith no apparent purpose.Now from the ending scene we see someone coming to rescue Bran and Meera and most people think it's Benjen Stark / Coldhands so a possibility here is that when Bran was marked Benjen felt it and learned where he was, then headed towards him to rescue him, he came a bit late but just in time though to save him and Meera.Now to cross the wall south, Benjen woud have to chopp both his hands off and Bran his right arm, they have now someone to help with that, Meera, (and by the way haven't you noticed that we never saw the bloodraven's hands? and that he too can't walk? yes you guessed it, the BloodRaven is possibly Bran himself, just an older "him"). I believe that some bloody hands chopping off will be going on anyway before they cross the wall south and join the night watch where Bronn is now lord commander and would direct them to Jon Snow who is getting ready for a battle to wich Bran could possibly contribute by warging into stuff (Jon's direwolf? maybe).This failsafe crossing will basically lock the WW for some time until maybe as some people have been theorizing that someone would blow the horn (Euron Greyjoy?) and bring the wall down, and we can only hope that the westerosi armies would be united, equipped (dragons, valyrian steel, dragonglass), and ready by that time to fight back, .. but that is a topic for another time.
s06e05	I’m a bit late to this because this is the episode that made me decide that it’s time to drop the show altogether. I’m a bit too tired to even bother with it, but I’ll do a quick writeup. I won’t be writing one for the upcoming episode tonight.First things first, yes — the final scene involving time-traveling warging and them showing how Hodor turned into Hodor alongside his death scene…was legitimately emotionally touching. I don’t think that every single aspect of the show is bad, but….In the first scene of the episode, it was funny to see how they lampshaded how ridiculous it was for Littlefinger to give Sansa to the Boltons. Aidan Gillen and the writers confirmed that he didn’t know. So it’s just some honest mistake that he gives up what is perhaps his MOST VALUABLE asset? Ramsay had the Ironborn at Moat Cailin publically flayed. He wasn’t aware of that? Littlefinger just looks dumbfounded, and obviously he would be — there’s absolutely no conceivable excuse he could come up with! Also, I love how Sansa and Brienne don’t point out his weird perpetual smirk while he’s supposed to be groveling/apologetic.Meereen and Dany: Kinvara’s interactions with Tyrion and Varys were interesting. I’d be interested in seeing how Dany’s (potential) relationship with the religion of R’hllor plays out. I bet that’s how Jorah cures his greyscale.Castle Black: Sansa apparently sees it fit to lie to Jon about meeting with Littlefinger and the reveal about the Vale’s forces. I can understand not trusting Littlefinger, but…why bother sending Brienne to the Riverlands? First of all, she shouldn’t have even needed Littlefinger to reveal that the Blackfish took back Riverrun. If Varys is aware of Stannis’ defeat all the way in Meereen, something like Riverrun being in Tully hands should be public knowledge. Also…the Riverlands is flanked by hostiles on multiple fronts — the Westerlands, and other southern armies allied with the Iron Throne (the Reach being one of them). It should be obvious that the Tullies shouldn’t be able to send anything substantial. Of course, Brienne still apparently has a Riverlands plot to get done, so she gets shoehorned into nonsense yet again!King’s Landing: All of it was pretty interesting and refreshingly plausible. The High Sparrow is one of my favorite characters, because the fact that he’s so capable at manipulation yet driven by absolute morality is such a neatly unique contrast. I wouldn’t be surprised if he comes out on top over the Lannister-Tyrell alliance.Iron Islands: Oh boy…..this is the reason I was still willing to give the show a second chance and watch Season 6. They blew it, and I regret even giving a second chance. I was really looking forward to seeing Euron Grejoy and the amazingly well-developed and non-generic culture/setting of the Iron Isles on screen. I wanted to see in showEuron a villain that would make Ramsay look like a yelping chihuahua barking for more scraps of dog show. There was a new chapter GRRM revealed at Balticon that revealed even more interesting things about Euron. I expected to see a charming, knowledgeable, daring, world-traveling pirate who has established a fearsome reputation all around the world and has treasures/magical artifacts and badass boasts to indicate it. Instead, all I saw was the Westerosi equivalent of a drunken country bumpkin who comes late to a Kingsmoot, takes Yara’s victory away by making a few well-placed sexist/dick jokes, gets away with publicly revealing kinslaying and kingslaying by saying he should have done it years ago, and announces “Where are my nice and nephew? Let’s go murder them!” after he almost seems to get killed during his baptism-by-drowned-god. He then seems to be left behind with about a dozen supporters, looking at numerous ships which must be manned by hundreds, if not thousands of people who…didn’t support him? He then declares that every tree in the Iron Islands get cut down to build a 1000 ships. Obviously, this shouldn’t be plausible, but we’re supposed to just overlook it for the sake of appreciating the show.And there are too many glaring things I’ve came across in this season which I have to overlook to appreciate the show, and I just can’t do that! This is no longer the thought provoking, unique low fantasy series I fell in love with.
s06e05	See, without Cersei and Jaime dragging it down with their boringness, I enjoy this show a lot more. Now if we can only cut out Dany, Jorah, Tyrion and Varys, we’ll have a cracking show.We are almost mid-way in discerning what each episode of Game of Thrones Season 6, would hold for us. Strong winds suggests that Game of Thrones Season 6 episode 5, would set a benchmark for what’s to come in future episodes. We have managed to crack few plots to help us understand the intricacy of this episode.Game of Thrones Season 6 Episode 5 Prediction, Watch OnlineGame of Thrones Season 6 Episode 5 OnlineGame of Throne season 6 episode 5, will be big on White Walkers. If you missed out on any special effects from Season 5, then wait for season 6 to blow your mind. The White Walkers are back, back with a bang! And not only would this, Episode 5 GOT Season 6, be swarming with White walkers, but, you would see the army lead towards Castle Black killing all. A broken promise by the Nights watch to “Stay True”, by killing their Lord Commander, breaking the spell that kept the very foundation of the Castle Black safe. One can only wish a major intervention to happen before the wall falls apart.Here’s what possibly happens next on Game of Thrones Season 6 episode 5 watch online, remember how Jon Snow burnt Ygritte’s body under Weirdwood tree. Same would happen to Jon’s body, taken by Jon’s friend Tormund Giantsbane and Eddison Tollett. And before Tormund or Edd could burn Jon’s body, the Nights King turns up and touches Jon’s forehead, awakening a blue eyed Jon Snow the “White Walker”.Also check : Watch Game of Thrones Season 6 Online Streaming FreeThere are many theories going around. One possible outcome of Game of Thrones season 6 episode 5, has been described above, alternately, if we look on the other side, there are strong chances that this episode would do a 360deg turn and we see Jon Snow resurrected by Melisandre making Jon the Lord of Lights, as the Azor Ahai reborn. Stannis being slain by Brienne of Tarth, makes Jon the potential candidate to bring down the White Walkers. Without Jon Snow there is no chance for Castle Black to survive with the army of White Walkers. Post this, we can be all set for Jon Snow with his Valyrian steel sword and Nights King with a major face off. Shudders!! Go Jon Go!!!Whichever way you go one, would see the fate of White Walkers and Jon Snow in this Game of Thrones Season 6 episode 5 online.On the side lines, we would also see what comes of Lady Caterlyn. We’ve heard that Beric Dondarrion would be the one to give Catelyn Stark the kiss of life and making her come back as Lady Stoneheart. Vengeance for her children’s and grandchilds death would be the main motto of Lady Stoneheart. Here we also see Lady Stoneheart take over the leadership of the Brotherhood without Banners, a group of outlaws.Also check : Personality quiz – What’s Your Game Of Thrones House?The makers of Game of Thrones Season 6 don’t want much of the highlights to be announced revolving around Lady Stoneheart. Alternately, this could just be rumours doing the rounds, while a strong and surprising plot is being built for the return of Lady Stoneheart. One just needs to wait and watch what comes of it.This was probably the first episode in this series’ history that I as a long time book fan literally stood up with my jaw dropped at what was happening on the screen. So many theories confirmed; so many other theories quashed in this episode. Previously bits from the show that hadn’t featured in the books were either so obvious(Daenerys) or just not going to happen that way in the books(anything with Sansa or Brienne…) But the Bran scene had me floored.A lot of scenes of people asserting good old fashioned dominance: Sansa dominates Littlefinger; The Waif dominates Arya; The Red Priestess dominates Varys; Euron Greyjoy dominates Yara and Theon; Bran dominates Hodor;The North—some good solid soap opera going on between Sansa and Littlefinger. Littlefinger is still manipulating Sansa. People all over the internet are bitching about Sansa lying to Jon: these are the same people who bitch about her being so honest to everybody. I think holding her cards close to her chest is a good thing; and I’m not so sure she should trust Littlefinger with his men. I mean, from her point of view. We saw what happened the last time Littlefinger offered to help someone(Ned.) But what confuses me, is why is Melisandre at that table? I mean, isn’t Melisandre all about fighting the White Walkers? Isn’t that her MAIN THING? And suddenly she’s all just involved in the council meeting to take Winterfell? This show needs to think things through a little bit. I have a sour taste in my mouth about Brienne and Tormund Chocolate Stealer because my HILARIOUS post about him last week was flagged for being a joke answer, even though it wasn’t really a joke, it was just funny. Lord Commander Edd Tollett. ‘Don’t Let the WAll Fall Down while I’m gone.” Jon says.Gee, I wonder what that was foreshadowing? Hamfisted Weiss and Benioff strike again.Braavos—impressive as it is and despite the fact that it works cinematically, you have to wonder what the whole beat Arya training is good for? I understand it’s some brainwashing technique, but it seems to be an end to itself. When Arya can’t hit the Waif, she’s failed: as if the whole thing is to hit the waif. By not hitting the waif, she proves that she’s not ‘one of them.’ Yet, if she hit the waif, wouldn’t that prove that the waif wasn’t one of them? And anyway, what do all these quarterstaff shenanigans have to do with being a Faceless Man? How often are Faceless Men going to have to deal with people coming at them and fighting like that? It’s like the show has combined water dancing of the books with, er, Faceless Manning. It’s funny how the show boils thing down to sheer obviousness: Kill this innocent person or we’ll kill you.But the play…though the circumstances are slightly different, the play(based on a play from the Mercy chapter from the yet-to-be-released Winds of Winter…I mean THIS is George RR Martin. You can really tell that this is the product of a great mind: the play is so multi-layered: it comments on nature of drama and it’s distortion of events for the sake of story, as good king Joffrey is betrayed by the evil Tyrion and Stark’s head is cut off; it works as history: medieval drama really was that silly; it works as we see the affect on poor Arya at the story being told and how it ‘reminds’ her of who she is—so, so sad. And it’s funny as hell. So when Arya says she’s made her decision at the end, I think it’s clear: she’s out of there! On the other handd, was that Richardd E Grant as one of the actors? I can’t imagine that he would have such a small role in this show: I assume he’ll be back.Daenerys—”find a cure and then come back. I’ll need you in Westeros.” Ah, see? This is just shit. I mean pure, unadulterated, unpasteurized, grade A, unfiltered, free-range, grass-fed, non-biodegradable nuclear SHIT. I can buy Dany walking unburnt through the fire. No problem. But Jorah just merrily riding off to cure an incurable disease? Puh-lease. Obviously, Benioff and Weiss screwed up by giving Greyscale to Jorah and now they have to backpedal furiously because ‘they need him’ with Dany for whatever the plot demands. Stupid.The Iron Islands—Yara is, like, queen of the Game of Thrones montage, isn’t she? I liked the King’s Moot scene. Show Euron has all the spookiness and freakiness and madness shaved off him. Why is the show so afraid to get freaky? But it does what it does and I thought it worked well. Some other reviewer remarked about the whole kinslaying taboo having gone out the window. I could write alot about how the show boils everything down to life and death. I don’t like it, but the show does, so I think that Euron’s gleeful admission of murdering his brother and his wishes to murder Theon and Yara make sense within the confines of the show.I totally called that Theon would be taking Victarion’s place. I didn’t call Yara doing it.By the way, Theon’s accent totally changed. That thick Yorkshire accent he’s been doing…it was mostly gone. I don’t like that.Meereen: Speaking of stupid, I thought Tyrion was all-good, all-knowing? I can’t think that his spreading the News of Daenerys’ godhood is all that good idea. And the show hates religioun with a passion. So working with the Red Priestess is going to backfire. Nice face acting from Conleth Hill, seriously. I bought his horror and fear. But, where exactly is it going? Are the Red Priests going to screw things up for the fragile peace, or…ooh, yeah. I forgot. I don’t care.Bran: WOW. So this is what it’s like for show-only watchers. A dozen fan-theories confirmed or destroyed in a few scenes.Children of the Forest made the White Walkers to defend themselves from humans!! Someone on reddit pointed out a throwaway line from A Storm of Swords: “Was it really an Other you killed, Sam, or just a child’s snow knight?” Grrm strikes again!White Walkers/Others are NOT bothered by fire. Fire does NOT destroy them. Repeat Fire does not destroy them. Only the wights.Hodor. That ‘hold the door’ theory was always one of the funniest and most pointless bits of tinfoil I’ve ever read. And yet…apparently… Laughing my a off.No Tower of Joy revelation, but don’t worry, we’re getting it.I have to wonder about Summer dying. Do you all think that it happens that way in the books? I tend to think Summer will survive that episode in the books, and they killed him off because of budget and shock value. But Hodor’s death felt all too book-like, for me: effectively because Hodor gives his life for Bran, but because Bran wargs him and ruins his mind. There is no way that Benioff and Weiss came up with that idea: that’s GRRM all the way.. And which way were they heading? North or South? I think something has to happen at the standing stones, which I think is where the White Walkers took the Craster’s baby in Season 4, right?I don’t know if it was just the spoiler power of the last scene or the lack of Jaime and Cersei’s boring boringness or what, but I enjoyed this episode more than most.
s06e05	Warning : **Spoilers ahead! ** Don’t read if you haven’t watched the episode....If you would ask me to review this episode, then I would definitely coin it as one of the best episodes of this season and possibly one of the finest of the entire series.The episode starts with the encounter of Sansa and LittleFinger. The evolution of Sansa Stark from a stubborn Stark child to this Strong and Confident lady fills me with awe. Sophie Turner has justified her character in every possible way and I have become a fan of hers in this season. Once again, LittleFinger has made us wonder that what is actually his master plan!Coming to Arya, fighting hard against the feelings exploding inside her when her father’s death scene is re-enacted, she is trying her best to become no one! The Faceless Man storyline never fails to amaze me! Let’s see what future has in store for Arya!The meeting scene of Jorah and Daenarys was quite emotional and sets Jorah on his quest to search for the cure while Daenarys leads the Dothrakis on her mission to rule the Seven Kingdoms. Once again, quite an emotional moment in this season.Heading over to Tyrion, this little man is probably a delight to witness in each episode. The perfect dialogue delivery, the witty lines, just can’t get enough of him. Once again, he has shown us how helpful he can be to the queen. Lord Varys’s reaction on learning about his past from the Red priestess was again a high point in this episode!Now, here comes the best part in the entire episode. This season, most people would agree that Bran scenes are the best. So much mystery, so many revelations. This season couldn’t have been so astonishing had not Bran been a part of it. The secret behind Hodor’s Hodor was revealed and it really gave me Goosebumps. Hats off to GRR Martin, the way he connected the dots and finally disclosed “Hold the door” was an absolute genius! Though Hodor’s death made me cry :/ Also, one more Direwolf gone. :( The entire White Walkers vs Children of Forest scenes were also greatly shot.Finally, the time has arrived that Bran would take the three eyed raven’s place and all his powers will be revealed. However with nobody left to protect him, it’s interesting to see how he will survive. The episode has made a great progress into the future storylines and finally all the loose pieces are falling into place. This was one hell of an episode and I can only say that the coming 5 episodes have too much to offer. Looking forward to an even more amazing season ahead. Definitely my favorite season so far! :)
s06e05	Well, this was sort of better than the previous four episodes of this season (a pretty low bar), and it actually had a plot, unlike most of the episodes this seasons … so yay? Also, it lacked Ramsay and the High Sparrow, two characters whom I want to stab whenever they show up on the screen … so double yay.On the other hand, most of what we did see on screen made no sense or was outrageously offensive (D&D’s signature style, in other words). The whole Hodor/hold-the-door nonsense was an insult to viewers’ intelligence (so of course, some viewers are lapping it up, because they’d rather believe that this is all ~so complex and smart~ rather than being incredibly stupid).The Kingsmoot was terrible and utterly illogical, but I never expected it to be otherwise, so I wasn’t really surprised. I don’t care about the Ironborn even in the books, and I care even less on the show, so whatever.Sansa had a sort of good scene with Littlefinger, but it mainly served to highlight what an insansely stupid plot she had been thrust in last season. And also the whole thing about her suddenly not trusting Jon was yet another pointless ~twist~. Last week she’s all aboard the Jon-train, but now, the moment Littlefinger reminds her that Jon is her half-brother (as if she didn’t know that already), she suddenly doesn’t trust him anymore. Argh!Arya’s story was the one I liked the most - or at least the whole play scene was good (the backstory of the Faceless Men was pointlessly changed to be the opposite of what it is in the books, but that’s par for the course for the show). Apart from that utterly random and gratuitous crotch shot, the play and the backstage scenes were a lot of fun. Also, they were in daylight, which is a rare commodity on this show.Tyrion and Dany did some things … I may have fallen asleep due to boredom in those scenes, so I’m not sure.
s06e05	Spoilers“Hold the door!”… Easily the highlight of the episode. So much death for so little gain. Bloodraven, the children, Summer, Hodor… What was the point of Bran’s journey North? It felt like he had only begun summer school before the shit went sideways. What was the point, I keep asking. Why hire Max Von Snowden instead of the guy from season four, then kill him after ten minutes’ screentime? Why kill a Direwolf I'm such a senseless fashion? Why kill the Children like they're unimportant? And Hodor, who I'm not much fascinated with, getting plagued in the past by being warged in the future… Holding the door. Really exciting, this one.Sansa has lied to Jon. That was the most important takeaway from their arc this episode. She lied about who gave her the info on Blackfish. I think that Blackfish will eventually tell her about Robb's will, disinheriting her and naming Jon a Stark, and his heir. This may bring back some friction between them. Or Baelish might use it to try that.Baelish knew exactly what he threw Sansa into, he's not an idiot. But he talked himself.out of getting killed by Brienne.Brienne will never trust Davos or Melisandre. But we knew that already.Yara was stunningly reliant on Theon. Not sure I liked that. In the books she was inches away from becoming Queen under her own steam. She swayed all the men there on her own. Theon standing up for his sister, for anyone actually. Is touching, but robbed Yara of the tide that should have been hers.Daenerys is now commanding people not to die. To get cured of an incurable disease. And she expects to be obeyed too. Wow.Tyrion invited a fanatic to turn Dany into a messiah. We know how that went with Stannis. Wonder how much worse Daenerys will be. Kinvara was able to get under Varys’ skin. No easy task that.
s06e05	SpoilersSO MANY DEATHS. What is the point of having fantastic (plot lines) characters like Bloodraven, the children of the forest, Hodor and freaking hell NOT ANOTHER DIRE WOLF if all they're there to do is to serve one of the main characters for a little while and then die?  It feels like the show runners are running away with the plot and hurriedly cutting every loose thread they find. With a blunt, rusty scissors.Rant over.The other plot lines are going fairly well, Arya's , Sansa and Jon's (although I really want to know why Sansa doesn't trust Jon) I found the Children of the Forests' creation of the Walkers pretty surprising, considering they hunt with dragon glass, which made me think they were not on the Others' side. I suppose it should only make sense that if they knew how to create them they know how to defeat them.I wish Theon had given his speech before Yarra's. It made it look like Theon bagged her more votes than she did, herself. And she has more power than that. I loved the intercutting of scenes between the run away Greyjoys and the swearing in of Who-Ron. I mean, Euron.<Suddenly a wild Khaleesi-Jorah moment appears> and then Jorah disappears. OK then.Finally Tyrion addresses the elephant in the room. Ruling the kingdom after it is conquered. I'm not sure what to think of the new red priestess.After that, I don't want to talk about the remainder. I'm so confused as to whether I love it or hate it.
s06e05	For me, this was definitely the best episode of the season so far. Obviously, there’ll be some spoilers ahead.The HSQ (holy shit quotient) was through the roof. Lots of reveals and WTF moments. While I’ve heard several theories that the Children and the White Walkers are somehow connected, actually having it confirmed is pretty big. The Hodor origin story is also something I’ve seen hypothesized (if only lately), but again actually seeing it on screen was heart-breaking and sad.But what really caught me by surprise was the army of White Walkers actually showing up at Bloodraven’s cave this episode! We knew Bran was going to leave, but I certainly did not expect it this soon.I was sad to see Summer go - It seems like the direwolves are cut due to CGI costs, which kind of sucks.The other parts of the episode were less exciting, but I did like the play Arya attended. Nice that they adapted that part of the Mercy chapter for the show. Also, the Blackfish will be back. Yay!
s06e05	I speculated the role of Children of The Forest in the others army and surprisingly it was true so here is the link to that Ashutosh Vishwakarma's answer to How will Game of Thrones end? and Ashutosh Vishwakarma's answer to Could the children of the forest be evil? I still suspect COTF role in bringing humanity down with the help of Bran and that is why leaf was trying to protect him from the undead.
s06e05	I already wrote a synopsis to the episode, being emotionally charged at Hodor's fate. :( Please read it here if you wish -Sayoni GuhaThakurata's answer to [SPOILER] In HBO's synopsis for Game of Thrones season 6 episode 5 “The Door,” it is stated that “Bran learns a great deal.” What is it?
s06e05	Poor Hodor, stunning revelation and apparently told to HBO people by George Rr Martin himself. Not big fan of HBO killing off Brans \U0001f436 #ripsummer
s06e03	Every other answer on this question has termed it "boring". I don't know why. Maybe they all are book-readers and were expecting a lot from this episode and were disappointed. Yes, it didn't have much of plot advancement, or mad dragon fights or eerie zombie attacks, but I loved the episode.It had a lot of symbolism and deep philosophy.[SPOILERS from here]Ned StarkAll the viewers had believed that Ned was the only honourable man in the grey-world of GoT. We knew every character was a shade of grey, and there were no black or white characters. But, we had always thought Ned was the proper honourable person, and he even got beheaded for that.But, is Ned truly honourable?In his greatest fight, against the most famous knight, Ser Arthur Dayne, he says that he had defeated him.Was stabbing in the back honour?Was lying to his kids about it honour?But, when we think deeper about it. Howland Reed was the person to backstab. How would people react to that? And how would people treat Howland from then on? What would Meera think about her own father's lack of morality?So, Ned lied to protect Howland's respect. We also know that the whole of Westeros immensely respects Ser Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. Would he receive the same respect by his fellow knights if they get to know that he was killed by a small knife by a cannogsman?So, Ned lied to protect Dayne's legacy.It was dishonourable to stab a person in the back. It was dishonourable to hide that fact. It was dishonourable to lie about it.But, it was honourable to do it to save others' respect and legacy. Even if they are your enemies, or friends.The choice of taking the dishonourable path to ensure honour, is a beautiful poetic event.Ned chose to lie. To save someone. Will he do it again? We shall wait and see.Jon SnowJon comes back from death, and Melisandre asks him what did he see in the great beyond.He says "nothing". He knows "nothing" about the afterlife.Ygritte had always said "Jon Snow knows nothing".In this episode, it is shown that "Jon truly knows nothing". Because he has been to the "nothing".Isn't that a beautiful play of words? Poetic indeed. Great writing.Another brilliant scene is the "Execution" of his murderers.You can clearly see the hesitation on Jon's face. He knows what they did was right, from their perspective. He also knows killing their Lord Commander is punishable by death.Even though he knows they are right, he knows that he is more right. He has seen the White Walkers' strength, and he knows he had to do what he had to do.Is executing men who are doing their own duty correct? Isn't loyalty to an organization more important than just taking orders? Is killing a child, even though is deluded and full of hatred, an honourable thing to do? Why do we have juvenile laws then? Would Jon not know that Olly is not mature enough to understand the bigger picture? Would Jon not know that Olly is consumed by hatred, consumed by guilt, and he did what he could do?But, is betrayal of a person and murdering him in cold blood a genuine excuse for the hatred inside you? Tough choices. Tough decisions. Tough circumstances.And we can see all this going through in Jon's head through his expressions. That moment of hesitation was truly great performance.Also, that one guy asks Jon to tell his Mother that he died doing the right thing. The only thing that matters to him, even at his death, is his Mother's approval. (A nice touch on Mother's Day)It shows that his whole childhood, his whole adulthood, his whole career with the Night's Watch has been to please his Mother. To show that even he is a good kid in front of his Mother's eyes. That sentiment is very deep. And he conveyed it beautifully in his one dialogue. Even the High Sparrow talks to Tommen about the beauty of mother-hood. (Mother's Day celebrations everywhere :D)Cersei Lannister The ultimate question still eludes me. Where does true power lie?When Robert was the King, the King had true power.After his death, the Small Council had true power.When Joffrey was King, the Hand, Tywin had true power.Then the Faith started getting power. (With Cersei's permission)Now, who has the true power? Not the King. Not the Faith. Not the Small Council. Not the Hand of the King. Who? What makes power yours? Official position one holds? One who commands a vast army? One who has the support of the masses? One who has his whisperers? Who?Cersei does not have an official position. Cersei does not have a vast army. Cersei does not have the support of the masses. Cersei is not even a Queen.Yet, Cersei holds the Power. Why? How? Kevan Lannister, the Hand of the King, controls the whole Lannister Army and the Gold Cloaks. Olenna Tyrell controls the whole of Reach and has the Queen herself as her grand-daughter. The High Sparrow controls the whole city's population and the downtrodden. Tommen, is the Official King.Yet, why do all bow down to Cersei? Power lies where all believe it to lie. Beautiful scene. It is better to storm out of the room and hide, than face Cersei.[END SPOILERS]You cannot expect every single episode to have a shocking twist, a mega-fight or dragons. You cannot expect every single episode to move the plot further. You cannot expect every single episode to be the best one you would ever see.You need to learn to handle your expectations.I personally think this episode was great. It had a lot of symbolism, lot of philosophical underpinnings, lots of depth and lots of psychology. (Varys' way of blackmail. Excellent) It had an excellent fight Dayne fight too. (7 vs 2) I don't know what more people can expect.I think most of the other answers here are the book-readers, who have read every single theory online and had a lot of expectations from this episode. (ToJ scene)Honestly, the TV show has done it better. Think from the perspective of a first time watcher, who has no intense researched background about all the theories. He first heard about Lyanna over five years ago, in the first episode, for ten seconds where they show her statue.And again in this season, in the first episode. You need to lay enough ground for them to truly absorb the intensity of the reveal.Honestly, most of the people still think Rhaegar had kidnapped and raped Lyanna. That is what the show has also told us till now. And I think the reveal has to be in bits and pieces, slowly going step-by-step and do a mega twist to shock the viewers.And it is just Episode 3 for god's sake. We still have 7 more weeks to go. So, no, the episode was not boring. It may not have captivating scenes, but if you watch closely and think about it, this is one of the deepest episodes out there.I LOVED THIS EPISODE. Giving it 4/5.Damn, I love this show.PS - One of the other review-writers of this question has just pinged me saying I didn't know what I was talking about. Haha. I read the previous episode reviews of all the other "great" answer writers here, and they did nothing but criticize. Every single episode!I mean, I don't know why they have this superiority complex and act so snobbish. They feel as if they were the true custodian of the books, and the show was just ripping it off. They honestly feel that the show is beneath them! And look at them whine in the comments. Gosh. That is too much negativity to handle. I mean, they assume everyone else is stupid and they act as if only they know what they are talking about, because, you know, "books"!Blah. These self-appointed Knights of ASOIAF trying to slay all the GoT Episodes is just pathetic. Lame. Lame. Lame. Sorry for the rant. 
s06e03	For D&D bitching that they're close to running out of material, to the point of not having enough to flesh out two more full seasons, they're perfectly happy to while away an entire episode without much of note happening.Castle Black: Jon's awakening was much more low-key than I was anticipating but it makes sense, I suppose, for him to be dazed and subdued. Luckily it looks like it won't last that long, if the Pink Letter comes like I think it will and say what I think it will. It felt wrong for Jon to hang the assassins instead of behead them, but Jon walking off felt natural even if you know it probably won't last (again, the Pink Letter and then if Sansa turns up I have a hard time believing Jon just listens to what happened to her without a reaction). Meereen: I just do not give a shit about Meereen. I don't. It amazes me that they got rid of a fairly intriguing fake-Aegon subplot in exchange for the Dornish clusterfuck and Varys getting what should be obvious intel out of someone based on Information From Somewhere. In the context of the show, how hard would it really be to figure out that three enemy cities might be bankrolling the guerrilla war in Meereen? Do we need Varys to figure that out? Am I supposed to be entertained when, for the millionth time, Grey Worm and Missandei don't "get" Tyrion's humor? Tower of Joy: The fight, even if for some crazy-ass reason was needlessly cut down in size (7 on 3 became 6 on 2 for reasons?), played out more or less like I figured it would. I'm sure GRRM's version, whenever we see it, will differ somewhat, but I'm comfortable enough to say that the "Arthur Dayne is alive" theory can probably be put out of its misery. I'm annoyed they cut away before the "money shot," but counterintuitively, that extension might just reinforce how important R+L=J really is. They can really only afford to draw it out (unless they shit the bed plotwise, which is possible) if the payoff is big but also if the payoff actually affects the plot. The more drawn-out R+L=J is, as annoying as it is, the bigger it probably affects the overall plot beyond "Rhaegar and Lyanna are Jon's parents, it means nothing, let's move on."Braavos: Arya finally made some progress and I'm guessing we move on to the theater troupe portion of her plot next, but I'm still waiting to see how Arya gets back to the main plot of the story and what impact her training will actually have. This is true in the books too; she's easily the hardest Stark to peg.King's Landing: I feel like they're getting dangerously close to wheel-spinning here. Cersei wants to kill people who mock her, Jaime's on her side for now, Tommen's not really sure what to do, the Faith is running roughshod over everything, can we get to the damn point already? Or at least get Jaime to the Riverlands where he actually does some interesting things? The Ship: I have nothing against Gilly except for the fact that she's yet another very minor character whose importance has been inflated. Makes sense to check in on them, I guess. Vaes Dothrak: I'm not sure what the show is going for here. Are we supposed to root for Dany to kill all these insolent Dothraki? Are we supposed to think it's unfair that Dany got to experience all the upsides of being Drogo's khaleesi without having to take any of the responsibility because she thinks it's beneath her? Or are we supposed to see it from the dosh khaleen's perspective that Dany's acting like an entitled, naive little pill? It's obvious what's going to happen: Drogon and Jorah and Daario will show up and save her and the Dothraki will be so awed by Drogon that they'll all follow her and yada yada yada. Rather than have to pay the piper as was expected of her, Dany gets to walk away scot-free as usual, because rules don't apply to her, see. It's all so stupidly predictable. Winterfell: I knew Umber's gift to Ramsay would be Rickon. I knew Ramsay would demand proof that it was Rickon and be given Shaggydog, either already dead or still alive but imminently dead. I don't know whether to be proud I correctly called it or mad that another direwolf is dead (one who's still alive in the books to boot). Rickon will probably feature in Ramsay's Pink Letter and it's probably part of what will motivate Jon to head south for Bastard Bowl. I get the change and I also suspect that Rickon may ultimately be sacrificed for either Jon's plot or Sansa's or both, where on the show they take over the Stark claim that Rickon might get in the books. Rickon looks headed in at least a somewhat different direction in the books, where he's on Skagos, with Osha and Shaggydog (who's, for now, still alive) and has Davos en route to him. Something tells me I'll like how the book handles it better ...ETA: I just remembered that Manderly tells Davos that he needs both Rickon and Shaggydog brought back from Skagos, to prove that Rickon is Rickon. So the grisly Umber's "proof" is sort of a nasty tweak on the book's plot, although in that case Manderly is obviously not wanting to kill the direwolf; he just needs Shaggydog with Rickon to prove his identity. Overall, not the best episode. I also don't have high hopes for next week after seeing the preview. :-/
s06e03	I bloody loved it!Series six is the first I've watched and so far I hadn't been convinced.  Jon's resurrection was especially disappointing: my impression is that 'magic' is some kind of Roadrunner, ACME brand magic.  Magic just happens and does stuff.Castle Black: or 'Davos has a potty mouth' - fine.Tower of Joy:  interesting, not the scene, but the tree stuff afterwards.  Bloodraven reckons he's been a tree for a thousand years.  I get that being a tree could be boring, but that's quite a discrepancy: perhaps he just likes the numbers 1000 and 1001, I know I do.  Another reference to Bran not being a tree forever: the main thing I took from episode 2 was the conversation between Meera and the 'Child of the Forest'.  Child of the Forest #1 tells Meera that Bran will leave the cave and that he will need her then.  How exciting.Ironborn:  The Damphair sucks.  His job is to be the grumpy old professor that doesn't think girls can do stuff.  Little does he know that the Drowned God has signed up for the #heforshe Emma Watson UN campaign.  Probably.  From episode 2, Euron is a strange show construction: we are to believe that he's so crap that his crew had to strap him to his boat during a storm, yet the same crew passively allowed him to remove all their tongues.  Bullshit.Meereen:  Varys has the voice of Richard Briers reading Paddington Bear and a commendable belief in the blamelessness of children.  Varys the Eunuch doesn't have children which may explain it.  Tyrion has worked his way through the boxset of House MD, speaking and moving in exactly the same way as Hugh Laurie, but nowhere near as sarcastic and funny.the Dosh:  Like the Golden Girls, the Dosh give hope to all women that they'll get more awesome with age, perhaps like Arbor Gold or a sour Dornish Red.  Bit worrying that the Khals have fitted Dany onto the AGM for the next season of 'Dothraki's Next Top Pillage'.  Hopefully, the Dosh will stage an intervention and overthrow the patriarchy with a convenient prophecy.  The patriarchy is no match for a convenient prophecy.Braavos:  Jaqen stands near a wall decoration that looks very much like a weirwood face.  Could be feng shui, or  he could have seen it in a magazine and had to have it.  Nice.King's Landing:  All the King's Council know about Ser Gregor, which is weird.  Kevan is rubbish.  The Queen of Thorns has forgotten to fuck off back to Highgarden in her wheelhouse with Left and Right.  Where's her wheelhouse?  Where the hell is Butterbumps?  I tell you what: if the High Sparrow hasn't allowed for The Mountain that Frankensteins in the upcoming Trial of the Seven Death-match, then he's a tool.  The 'little birds' have tongues, which again, is disappointing, but that enables them to do an Oliver, 'Please, Mr. Qyburn can we have some more (candied plums)?'  Children in Westeros are being spoilt and not dying nearly enough...Winterfell:  ...except for Rickon, whose chances I don't fancy at all.  The sweary Umber dude (Benedict Umberdude?) fails to realise quite how much he has in common with the Wildings: the 'no fucking kneeling', describing Roose and Daddy Umberdude as a c-word (I don't like that one, so I'm not typing it).  Rickon's couple of weeks in the wilderness have aged him hugely, from toddler to only slightly sub-teenager.Castle Black:  Jon has Gloria Gaynor-ed his way out the door and will come to regret leaving his warm, raven-mantled cloak behind.  Winter is coming and that's not sensible.Quick, someone bring Bloodraven a shrubbery!
s06e03	★★☆☆☆Boring. I mentioned this earlier and will have to say again that everything is just too easy. The characters don't really seem to grow, but change drastically with situations that they don't mould into. There is no drama where there should be: the brothers being tensed around each other and scuffles breaking out when Jon is dea- oh no wait he's alive, Arya being blind and being in impressive fight sequences while bl- oh wait she got her eyesight back, Ramsay living in constant fear while Sansa is away because of Roose who threatens to- oh hey Roose died. There's no anticipation, everything moves mindlessly towards something shocking, and as ever, Tyrion gets good lines that he absolutely does not need. Tower of Joy: I tried really hard to keep aside the status of legend this event has that the books have built up and just accept that the show decided it was not a big deal, but it was played down badly. Bran should have seen many more visions before he reached here, simply because he can see so much into the past and he would need to understand how important this vision is. If you are especially aware of what's in that tower and who the screaming woman was, you will think that this needed to be built up. But well, let's assume it wasn't a big deal, you'd still want Ned's obsession with honor and righteousness to be stressed a little bit more (Sean Bean has been dead for what, six years now?) before showing how Howland Reed stabbed probably the greatest swordsman of the time in the back. This was my favorite part of the scene, by the way. It showed that whatever Ned was going for made him so desperate that he was willing to put aside honor and actually kill Arthur Dayne any way possible. That's a very very important clue stressing just how important this small battle was. Of course, they butchered the whole scene. Braavos: I really wished she had become more skilled before she regained her sight back. I mean, I'm sure she has, but we didn't get to see it. Also, they're trying so hard to get her to forget Arya Stark and become No One, and yet, inexplicably, she's talking about the Lannisters and her brothers and her list. And promptly gets her sight back. It's confusing. King's Landing: I love that Olenna Tyrell is back. The lady is a pleasure to listen to. Also the semi-reveal that the thing in the armor is Gregor Clegane aka the Mountain was dropped a little too casually. The turn of events at the Small Council was fun to watch, and the High Sparrow seemingly converting Tommen to his side was unexpected and delightful. The ladies are going to lose it.Sam/Gilly: It was good seeing them after a while. Good to know she's going to Horn Hill. But what's she gonna do? Where is she gonna live? What will her identity be? Mereen: Meh. Why does Tyrion need so many empty lines! It does nothing for the story. Who Varys's "little birds" are was a fun reveal. Vaes Dothrak: They're gonna decide what to do with Dany since she didn't turn up there as soon as Khal Drogo died. Fair enough. Winterfell: I liked Smalljon Umber! The mutual back scratching arrangement is practical enough, and I'm just glad it wasn't Rickon's head as I was expecting last week. Poor Shaggydog though.Castle Black: Jon did the right thing by killing those who betrayed him, of course. I can't really decide if his cavalier manner of declaring that his watch has ended was underwhelming or brilliant. Technically, having died, his watch actually has ended and he's no longer bound by the vows he made to the Watch. I wish he had explained more. Considering he knows what's beyond the Wall, it seems very out of character for him to suddenly abandon his post and walk away. It looks like he's marching towards Winterfell now, possibly with the Wildlings. Melisandre did see him in the fire battling at Winterfell. Jon Snow vs Ramsay Bolton would be something to look forward to. Can't really say the same for the next episode, judging by the preview. 
s06e03	★★☆☆☆In a word, boring. Barely anything happened for most of the episode.Spoilers if you haven't watched Season 6, Episode 3 yet. (Image Source: THE TOWER OF JOY: An Adaptation)Let's start with the most awaited sequence first - the Tower of Joy. Or rather, judging from the un-watchtower-like structure, the Joyfort. Why was it so hard for them to stage a 7-vs-3 fight like in the books, instead of showing a 6-vs-2? Book fans have discussed to death what Eddard's words "if not for Howland" were supposed to mean, but it was just a plain old backstab. I'm sure the book version will be better. It has to be. And then they are just dragging out the Lyanna reveal. Arya's training montage was the one decent in this episode, which isn't saying much. The point of making Arya blind was that she can learn to use her other senses, and she does - hearing the footsteps and smelling those powders. I know it was silly of me to look for that cat, but I was hoping for something dramatic to happen before Arya earns her sight back. I guess Arya is going to be given another contract.Jon's scenes were a distant second, when it comes to the watchable (or perhaps rewatchable) scenes in this episode. He does a good job becoming dazed at the turn of events, and it was disappointing that he remembers everything - what was the cost for his return? And Melisandre throws in the phrase, the Prince who was promised. The execution scene was mostly satisfying, from a justice point of view that is, but I would have preferred beheadings. The man who passes the sentence and all that (though I suppose Jon did swing his sword at the elaborate rope-barrel contraption). Jon's watch ending, as he claims it, felt underwhelming - I couldn't really understand why he doesn't want to do it any more, now that he has taken care of those who murdered him for doing what he thought was right. Maybe that's the cost?Things are starting to happen in other places - In Meereen, with Varys giving us the names of the three closest cities to Meereen, and a few minutes of wasted screentime with Tyrion; At Vaes Dothrak, Dany gets a somewhat sympathetic welcome by the surprisingly young group of the dosh khaleen after they stripped her and gave her Dothraki garb. Sam and Gilly are on a ship to Oldtown... or really Horn Hill, and I'd like to see the itinerary where they can get to Horn Hill without going through Oldtown. King's Landing was a series of conversations - Qyburn buying the loyalty of Varys' little birds (who have tongues in the show) with candied plums (I think) from Dorne, Cersei and Jaime take a tour with Robert at their backs, first visiting Qyburn and then got to watch a small Small Council walk out on them, and Tommen finds a new grandfather to listen to.Finally, Winterfell. I've decided that I like Smalljon for now, who is a lot smaller than his book counterpart. His line of thinking is convincingly straightforward - if he had to choose between an army of wildlings, or making common cause with someone like Ramsay, it's an easy choice for him. But betraying the son of his former liege lord seems a bit extreme, and I half-believe that he was laying it on thick when he spoke about wanting to kill his father (who is supposedly dead now). And poor Shaggydog, I hope he died a better death than Grey Wind, at least the latter's butchery was on-screen.Overall, this episode was the worst of the three so far, but not by a lot. 5/10.
s06e03	Slow paced with nothing much happening of note.To pick each storyline for the review:Castle Black - Jon Snow delivering swift justice to mutineers was something I personally didn't expected. I was hoping that he would be able to persuade Ser Alliser to join his cause and take the post of commander, as his leaving the post was always on the cards. Would have felt hurried, sure, but that wouldn't be the first time on the show. Jon seemed tired and aged beyond his years and that made sense as his sense of betrayel is still raw. He would be back in his fighter self soon as other storylines are merging - Sansa (like Alys Karstark) is approaching Castle Black and Rickon is the new ManceWinterfell - One thing I liked about the scene was that Smalljon cut Ramsay to his size. But seeing severed head of Shaggydog hurt. Best case scenario for Rickon is that Ramsay will make him a cloak of Osha skin (substituting him and Osha for Mance and spear wives). Other scenarios are not at all good for him. One thing surprising is that Smalljon said that they are most north than any one else and Osha and Rickon were going southwards towards White Harbour (in Manderley's region). So how did they end up being captured by Umbers?Bran and his visions - This part was completely underwhelming. Why the decision to reduce both parties by 1 at Tower of Joy? Was it to show the skill of Dayne when he fought with 4 opponents at once and just 3 people taking out Ser Hightower and Ser Whent would have been too much? But I really doubt if show producers care about that. The fight sequence was also not great or exciting to watch. The decision to kill Dayne by stabbing him from behind was also strange to me. Was it done to reinforce the skill of Ser Arthur Dayne who couldn't have been killed in a fair fight by multiple combatants? So many questions!!!Dawn was sacrificed as well for the sake of spectacle of Ser Dayne fighting with multiple people. Sam and Gilly - They are in transit making their way to Horn Hill and show!Gilly is 100x more perky than the Book!Gilly. At least she is getting some happiness in her lifeArya Stark - To me it was the strongest part of the episode. The editing successfully gives an idea of time passing with each session Arya had with the waif and how she is learning and getting stronger. The kill list is now really short though!!!King's Landing - Second strongest part with Cersei doing what she does best. She is not the subdued book!Cersei which Kevan meets in the final chapter of last book but fierce show!Cersei who is out for blood and vengance. Jamie seems confused and startled with so much going around and is just following Cersei around. High Sparrow showed his gift with words and a young and impressionable Tommen can be persuaded to give Faith a upper hand over crown unless Cersei strikes soonMeeren - Boring and awful. Tyrion quipps doesn't amuse. Varys is not imposing, mysterious, or threatening. Missandei and Grey Worm can as well be the furniture in the room. And what are the dragons doing now? They have been freed, surely a dialogue could have been put in between to let the viewers know about their whereaboutsVaes Dothrak - I guess show runners want Dany to be disliked in a different way in show as compared to books. They are going to make her incredibly thick and dumb. Why does she keep repeating to every Dothraki she meets that she is the mother of dragons and first of her name and Queen of Meereen and best thing to happen since sliced bread and what not. They don't give a rat's ass. She has lived among them and she must know that. And that's what is happening. They hear her, then they laugh at her and ridicule her. Is the sole purpose of these events to create a platform from which Dany will avenge her humiliation? So that viewers will cheer for Dany when Drogon will finally appear? For now, this arc is just idiotic.
s06e03	Note: I’m reviewing “Game of Thrones” from the perspective of someone who has read all of George R.R. Martin’s novels and watched the All episodes of Game of Thrones (TV series).★★★☆☆ Why? - It wasn't exciting an episode as the last couple.There are lot more reviews in details So, I am summing up mine in couple of paragraphys:While this wasn’t as exciting an episode as the last couple, it was still packed with goodies. Seeing Jon Snow back from the dead answers some questions and opens the doors for others. Bran’s vision was probably the most exciting moment of the episode for me, though I wish they’d actually made Ser Arthur Dayne’s sword, Dawn, more exciting. Oh well.We’re moving just barely forward at this point in the season, and three episodes deep the wheels are still turning very slowly. The tension in King’s Landing is sure to mount now that the Queen of Thornes is here. Jon and Ramsay will almost certainly go to war now. And I suspect that her allies will attempt to free Daenerys soon as well. Perhaps war will also come to Meereen, and Dorne will raise its banners. More war, more clashing of kings and queens and so forth.Whatever happens, it hasn’t happened yet. The season has been full of revelations, but things are still building. That’s okay. I love the tension and not knowing exactly what’s coming. And I guess that's waht kept/keeps us hoohked up with Game of Thrones (TV series) so far.Thanks for A2A Monu Kamble.
s06e03	(Show Spoilers) The theme of oathbreaker ran through the episode, but it was more apparent in some storylines than others. The episode tried to move key plot lines along, which seems to be the concern of the show creators as they are doing their best to complete the story. Of the three episodes in the season, this felt the least satisfying, even though there were no outright blunders, just annoyances and some gems as well.The Best:Jon Snow: Yes, the resurrection was underwhelming, but the show made up for that with a moving portrayal of a man murdered and returned from the dead. Jon is in shock. He cannot believe his brothers murdered him for doing what he felt was right. Davos served as a father figure to him, helping him transition into a world where he doesn't know where he belongs. Melissandre all but called him "the Prince that was promised", telling Jon that Stannis was not who she thought he was. It was good to see Jon connect with his loyal friends, Doloros Edd and of course, Tormund. The ending of the show gave dignity to Alliser Thorne. Like him or not, the man knew who he was, a man of the Night's Watch. How many of us would be so sure of our life's path as he was, as he faced his end? And as many predicted, Jon's watch now has ended. I would have liked more  of Jon Snow's story--that made me realize that the show had done well by him.. They just wanted to get the resurrection done so they could get back to telling his story. The Rest: Varys: We had the image of "little birds" beginning with him and concluding with a very sinister Qyburn. Varys was great as he worked with the prostitute who killed Unsullied, and worked for the Sons of the Harpy. We realized that Varys gets what he wants because as he tells the woman, he likes to make people happy. He tells Tyrion which cities is funding the guerrilla movement (Astapor, Yunkai and Volantis), but either he is choosing not to reveal the leader or he does not know. The Tyrion scene felt obligatory, as though we needed some humor that just felt out of place, but it served to show that Tyrion really isn't all that comfortable in Meereen, nor do the rest of Dany's circle seem to know what to do with him. Tower of Joy: I liked seeing Bran reach out to his father as he climbed up to the tower. Did Ned hear him? And wasn't that a baby crying? The show does not want us to think that Ser Arthur Dayne is actually alive as some do believe. Instead of Dawn, we had General Grievous lightsabers killing off every Northman we could see, save Ned of course, who knew he didn't stand a chance against Ser Arthur. The show has only introduced two major swords: Ice and Longclaw, so it was no surprise that we didn't get to see Dawn, but the sword double action struck me as a poor substitute. Still, Bran was obviously shocked that his father won, even though he had heard the story so many times, and I won't spoil that part.Ramsay: Well, many of us guessed the gift was Rickon and wondered why House Umber would turn traitor. As usual, I overthought it, looking through dialogue between the Greatjon and Robb, wondering about his connection to the Karstarks, along with the power motivations within the Umbers. So it turns out that the Smalljon is worried about the Wildings. (I chuckled.) He is also worried about Jon Snow. So he is willing to talk terms with Ramsay about his concern for his lands. I didn't see that one coming, as I gave House Umber more credit as fighters--really, that was very dissatisfying. The shock for me was Shaggydog. I spent too much time coming up with possible reasons for their betrayal, and not enough thought about their viciousness. The North truly has forgotten, as far as the show is concerned.Arya: The plot has gotten to the point where Arya is now possibly ready to become "no one". I did enjoy her fight scenes and I was reminded how much I miss the Arya from other seasons. A girl has been given a second chance to fulfill her promise,  and basically that is what we saw. Daenarys: I was hoping for some prophesy or sense of the future, but as usual, Dany goes somewhere to find out that she may not stay there for long. I am surprised we are on episode 3 and Dany has not found her way back to Meereen, but I believe the show will reveal something that matters for her storyline in the next episode. She is with the Dothraki for a reason, and I don't just mean in terms of plot, but I figure they will somehow assist her in her return back to Meereen or we are going to see some Drogo awesomeness along with some Jorah/Daario action.We got an introduction to Sam again, and Oldtown, plus a promise to get to know the Tarly family. Mace Tyrell asked his mother to sit on the small council, Uncle Kevan is back and Jaime insisted that he belongs on the small council too. Families and politics. As an American, I wondered if I was watching a session of Congress as everyone save Cersei, Jaime and Ser Robert Strong walked out. Meanwhile the king is getting schooled on religion from a man who reminds him of Tywin--that was interesting. The oathbreaker theme only seems to pertain directly to two sections: Jon Snow with the Night's Watch, and the various traitors in Winterfell.  It has some relevance to Ayra.Perhaps Dany broke an oath by choosing to be a queen instead of a widow shut away by the Dothraki, but there I go overthinking again. In all, the episodehad some strong points, and I like what they are doing with Bran and Jon, but as episodes go, it was uneven at best.
s06e03	Hm. I feel almost bad saying it among the bad reviews. Maybe I just don't have any taste or the bar's been set so low that I don't expect much but I liked it. Especially the Castle Black scenes.Segment by segment: I liked the scenes at the wall. I could complain, but there's no point. Jon leaving the wall, predicted by many, was well done. I liked seeing Olly and Alliser Thorne dead. They looked comical. And I like comedy. Yes, all the rough edges that make characters like Tormund Thunderfart and Dolorous Edd interesting in the book have been sanded off...but, like, three years ago, so I'm used to it.I liked seeing Sam. He's becoming one of my favorite show characters, maybe because he's not too far from the book. I also think the actress that pays Gilly is a cutie pie.Arya: it happened pretty much as I predicted but I liked it well enough. Again, I'm so used to the edges being sanded off that it doesn't bother me. To be honest, the only thing that pisses me off is pseudo-hipster lines like Cersei's monologue in Episode 1 about her dead mother. So terrible. The D's probably think it's sheer poetry. Dany was treading water but it was OK, we didn't see her last episode. Varys scene was well-played. Attractive actress.  They've butchered book Varys with the same cleaver they've butchered book Tyrion, but, again, I've long since stopped raging.Tyrion Missandei and Greyworm bit didn't really do it for me, but at least there was no love scene and Peter Dinklage got to play nervous, which is better than playing a know-it-all saint.Cersei and Jaime always bore me, but I liked the Tommen/High Septon meeting. I felt there is a quality to the Tommen actor that I found touching. He looks just like one of my students, that probably helps.Umber/Bolton scene was utterly predictable but I still was like OH MAN.
s06e03	It was an okay episode, I'd give it 2.5/5.Tower of Joy:One of the most important scenes in the story. Book readers have analysed every word of it in ridiculous manners, and it is good to see many theories like Dayne being alive, or Reed talking him out of it resting in peace. I loved the scene, the 2 vs 6 doesn't bother me at all. Ser Arthur Dayne was excellent, the choreography was excellent, and the tease for Lyanna conveys the importance of this scene. Also, we got to see "winds speaking".Castle Black:Somehow Jon's resurrection doesn't seem to have much weight. There should be some sacrifice, he shouldn't be back whole. Resurrection is a shady territory even in fantasy. And him casually rejecting the Night's Watch really felt out of character. Why would he end his watch when he knows the great threat, and that he is needed here to combat it? He rejected Stannis' offer, and now for no reason his watch is ended. It makes more sense if next week he receives the pink letter mentioning Rickon in a cloak in a cage and then goes berserk.Bastardbowl is almost confirmed. A Bolton-Umber against the Watch-Wilding alliance, with Jon Snow on a horse. And Peter Baelish pulling a Gandalf on this Helms Deep with his Vale forces. Meereen:The Varys scenes were brilliant. They reminded of the good old times when we intently listened to the dialogues and not drool over shock-events. Mentions of Astapor, Yunkai, and Volantis make one prediction more strong - of the oncoming war between Meereen and Astapor-Yunkai. I hope Tyrion leads the troops like Barristan does in the books. As for Volantis, Daenerys is going to stop there for a while before her final journey to Westeros, and you are not going to like it.Winterfell:Smalljon was good. He was tall, bear-like, and unapologetic "your father was a cunt". He was also an idiot. It is easy choice to make between wildings and a Northern house. But there are other ways to get help other than giving away the greatest asset you have in your hands. The Umbers could have done a lot with a boy Stark. And gift or not, the Boltons were definitely going to attack Jon Snow. The gift was a huge unnecessary waste by the Umbers.And Ramsay is so lucky, he got two Starks delivered to him for free! He had zero effort in both, and the delivery people got nothing in return. He actually shouldn't have lasted this long. Without Roose and Sansa, the Northerners would've baked him into a pie and be fighting over who'd take the Bolton lands.Kings Landing:Mention of the Hound in Braavos. Cersei talks about Trial by Combat. Ian Mcshane letting off the secrets. You know what is coming. 
s06e03	My watch has ended - Jon SnowI liked both episodes 1 and 2, but this felt like it finally had some momentum to start getting the story properly moving. I still feel like Arya and Dany's storying a boring me to tears. Everything which has happened for Dany so far could've been covered over in one episode, and likewise Arya, though I understand taking their time with the eyesight stuff.The Bran scene was great. I find it interesting that people keep saying that means R+L=J. Why? Sure, R+L=baby, but why Jon? I'm pretty sure it's Danaerys. I'm not sure why they thought they needed only two Kingsguard at the tower? And who was the other guy? Was it Whent or Hightower? I was also hoping for Arthur to throw some shade Ned's way about him being in love with Ashara, not being good enough for her, and making a comment about him having married Catelyn (which would've made for a fun awkward moment with Whent, given he's Catelyn's cousin).I was a bit shocked when they started calling the mountain Ser Gregor, rather than Ser Robert Strong, but in that Prince Doran is dead, and Dorne is already poised at war against them, why the charade. It took me a bit to realise why they were unailingly explicit about it. Bit of a shame, though, since it's pretty obvious in the book, it's kind of a blatant unsaid, because nobody wants to acknowledge it.I liked Jon's confusion and continued pain throughout. And I liked his disembarkment at the end. I just didn't like the two scenes being separated. What purpose did that serve? I realise that each episode seems to be top and tailed with the Wall, but I just would prefer more movement elsewhere.I'm unclear how long Sam and Gilly have been at sea, but it's a bit of a dick move telling her after all this time that he's dumping her with his mum and sister while he goes off to the citadel. I wonder if this is a way for the show to delay going to Oldtown, so we don't get any Euron-Samwell clash until season 8?I had expected Rickon back this season, and was very pleased they got the same actor Art Parkinson, but damn he got tall! In the books, he should only be 6-7 by now. The actor's 14, so it's yet another departure. But that aside, I really hope they don't kill of Rickon. I mean, seriously, he's one of my favourite book characters. Being on the Isle of Skagos should make him crazy. It doesn't seem impossible to go that route with the show, but killing off shaggy dog makes me skeptical.My greatest criticism, though, is just how disparate the storylines are now. The cohesion the show once had is gone, and there's no fluidity between moving between scenes. The only exception to this was Bran saying "what would I see in that tower" and the next thing you see is Dany. If I'm right about her parentage, that's a great hint.
s06e03	Spoliers..........A major flaw of this season so far has been that the showmakers have been trying to cram too much into each episode thus making each episode more or less a bundle of unsatisfying plots. This is in addition to a lack of dramatization and imagnation. Episode 3 was no exception.The thought process was good tying the title with the present and past actions of key characters, Ned, Jon, Danny etc. however the execution has not been right again due to plots that are both less interesting as well as lacking dramatization.IMO Bloodraven's character has become all about stretching the show, something that has not been necessary in the past. Are the show makers running out of plot material?The scene where Sam and Gilly are sailing IMO was totally unecessary. One might argue that Sam's an oathbreaker too and that may be right but that scene is still is a misfit. The scenes in Mereen were lackluster as well. We are used to see much more from the characters of Varys and Tyrion. What we got was them trying to make the best out of a rather bland plot.Arya's transformation into no one could not have been less dramatic. I wish her transition was shown more in detail. The only thing in the episode worthy of notice was the ending, where Jon resigns as Lord Commander and coldly declares that his watch has ended. Not too many may care about it, but to me it was bad ass.
s06e03	Lets be quick and finish it off instead of garnishing it with unnecessary fillers like the producers have.  Margery will face a trail, much like Cersie had but unlike Cersie, she has both the Tyrells and Lannisters holding her back. I am expecting an alliance in the near future. Meanwhile, I expect Tommen to turn to the ways of the High Sparrow, considering the dedication and attention with he was listening to his humongous preaching. How can you be so calm in front of the man who has made your mother walk the streets naked in the name of "atonement"?Meanwhile, Cersie and Jamie try their best to wriggle their arses into the king's council. However, Ollena and others have made it clear that they are wanted no more. Man the Lannisters are having a hard time. I so miss Tywin, sigh.Khaleesi reaches Vaes Dothrak, once again. She must escape these brutes who want her to spend the rest of her days repenting in the Khalar Vezhven. And then she begins her introduction. Yawn! Its high time you do something, Khaleesi.I am even disappointed with the Tower of Joy scene albeit the part when Ned does pause for a moment as Bran calls him from behind. We all know where this is heading, where Ned  is heading when we hear Lynna wincing in the pain of, childbirth? We will probably have to endure the drag through a few more episodes before we get to the root of Jon's parentage. But that it is happening in this season is for sure, or maybe they will end this season with this very cliffhanger.My breath did get stuck in my throat when I saw Rickon and Osha. Not to mention Shaggydog's decapitated head offered to Lord Bolton, the new one,mind you. Strikes odd, doesn't it? Lady is dead. Nymeria is dead or alive:Schrodinger's Cat. Greywind was slayed during the Red Wedding. Summer is snug within the caves along with Bran. And Ghost? Standing tall and strong. After all, whose dire wolf is it at the end of the day?We know Vala has been captured. Varys threatens a woman with her child in his own cunning way. The scene featuring the Tyrio was b-o-r-i-n-g. Like Tyrion, I was getting damn bored.Finally, we know who fed information to the Sons of Harpy and a great deal yet about their sources of finance. And who did the same to Varys. Little birds?Where?All I see is innocent kids hungry for love roaming the streets. Now that, is a pleasant surprise indeed.And now the ONLY scene that crosses the bar of expectations laid down for us since s06e02: the Lord Commander wakes up. Probably he wasn't as familiar with the idea of his resurrection as we were. Took him a while to absorb so much. I loved the way Ghost, ever affectionately, held his breath as Jon woke up. Never seen so much love among any two people in entire GOT. It is beauty to see Jon parading through the Wildlings, embracing Tommun and his friend, and even as he winces, we wince. We can't afford to lose him once more. Enough torment have we endured. He conviction of his Killers(Esp. Alliser Thornes and the prick Olly) didn't come much of a surprise to me. What was a surprise was Jon's head held high, dapper walk-away from the Night's Watch. What can the impotent death do when the Lord Commander himself renounces his vows. Jon so alleviates my fears in this gestures of his.cHe is hurt the most where Ollie has stabbed him, in the heart and his wounds haven't even healed yet. But he walks away. Punishing all those who had betrayed the Lord Commander. Renouncing his vows. Delegating his responsibilities.Wear it, burn it.My watch is ended.(Loosely translated to "Deal with your shit yourself from now on.")Loved watching Jon finally executing what is best for himself .Finally! We see Samwell and Gilly after what seems like an eternity. Through a brief storm ride, the producers have told us that both of them are headed to the Citadel but Sam plans to drop Gilly and their baby off to his place. They are headed south. Away from North when Jon resides? A reunion is far out of sight, for now.All in all, a pretty average episode but I'll cut it some slack considering our expectations are on cloud 9 since the last episode. Also, I feel instead of feeding us tidbits in the name of plot advancement, the producers should focus on one or two story lines per episodes and give us a decent treat, enough to last for one week.A decent 3/5 for me.
s06e03	Well Well , the episode's not out yet and boy aren't we waiting already!I'll write what I feel based on the preview and will definetely do a complete review once I'm done watching the episode.First things first , Jon is back.( The Red Woman , we LOVE you now ) The moment we waited for is finally here :D I am waiting to see the shock on some people's faces and what Jon decides to do to them.Secondly  Brian's vision + Tower of Joy , well its time to get our hands on some secrets regarding Stark family.Maybe we'd finally learn about the famous fan theory R + L = J 's validity.Thirdly what happens when the dragons are unleashed :PSo hold on to your seatbelts cause the ride has just taken off :)Edit :Well the episode had a slow pace attached to it.Jon Snow :Jon is back and how. He's out and ready to punish the ones who tried killing him. I particularly feel for Snow as Olly still gives him angry looks when he's up there hanging. The best part  of the entire episode 'Wear it , watch it , castle black is yours , my watch has ended'Tower of joy : Brian has the visions of the fights which have a changed version as compared to the book. Nothing spectular.Mereen : I had hoped that there would be some action in terms of dragons well no , people at Mereen are figuring out other stuff and Tyrion tries  playing drinking games.Winterfell : Ramsay in control of the situation after killing dad and now wants to be proclaimed as the Warden of the North.Arya Stark : Finally her training pays off as she regains her eyesight as well as now has stronger senses. She is no one.All in all there are a lot of things waiting to be told. And all we gotta do is let it all Build-up! Fin!
s06e03	This week's episode wasn't firing on all cylinders the way last week's was, but it was still an okay episode overall.In particular, I thought Jon's storyline was well-handled. Kudos to Kit Harrington for that initial scene, because it really was one of his better pieces of acting. He did an excellent job of portraying how unsettling and unnerving it would be to return from the dead remembering your own murder. Likewise, Melisandre was also strong in that scene, with her desperate questioning of Jon about the afterlife and fervent urging that someone must be Azor Ahai (pretty clearly Jon at this point).The concluding execution scene was probably my favorite of the episode. I really like what the show has done with Alliser Thorne; far from the straight-up jerk he was in the books, Show!Alliser has been portrayed in the last few seasons as a short-sighted but principled man who disagrees with Jon and acts on it. His final words were a perfect conclusion to that arc and very satisfying overall. I was scared for a moment that Jon was going to have mercy and cut Olly down. I'm glad he didn't - we needed to see that death has changed Jon. And like many have speculated in the past few months, Jon's watch has ended.The next-best scene was the long-awaited (and sadly incomplete) Tower of Joy scene. I wish they had kept the dialogue from the books between Ned and the Kingsguard, but on the whole the scene was still satisfying. Arthur Dayne was fun to watch, and Bran's commentary made the scene more enjoyable, in my eyes - there's nothing this show does better than strip away innocence. I should have known better than to think that we'd get to see the inside of the Tower of Joy, but it was still enjoyable.The rest of the episode was varying degrees of interesting: I'm really over Cersei trying to be Tywin, though I did love Kevan just up and leaving her when she tried to force her way into the Small Council meeting.Relatedly, Dorne got mentioned and now I'm terrified that Dorne is not over.As much as I love Tyrion, the extended scene between him, Grey Worm and Missandei was wholly unnecessary.After showing some promising signs of growing a backbone, Tommen almost immediately caved to the High Sparrow in conversation - I don't see this ending well.I asked where Sam and Gilly were last week, and now I regret it.Poor Shaggydog. I'm sure I don't like where the North is headed.Arya is one "Eye of the Tiger" short of a training montage. But she has her sight back now, so that's something. Other than Jon's scenes and the Tower of Joy, the only other scene I can say I definitely enjoyed was watching Varys in action. We've known for a while that Varys wields a lot of power and leverage, but I really liked him in action. I found him quite threatening and ominous in this scene, and I look forward to more like it.To be honest, I was hoping for more Sansa/Brienne this week, but was disappointed. Thankfully, it looks like she'll be back next week - along with Baelish (finally!). I'm ready to put this episode behind me as the first truly mediocre one of the season and get excited for whatever we're about to see in episode four.(Originally posted on my personal blog)
s06e03	I watch every episode twice before sleeping except today. The new format of Show all plot lines for few mins is not working with me. On top of it this seasons main problem is everyone's changed. There was an emotional connect with every character until this season. Cersei changed, Jon Snow changed, Jaime changed, Mellisandre changed, Davos changed and every other character we knew is dead. I don't give a shit about Dany and the Meeren, such a waste of Tyrion and Varys and screen time. Even though it is Young Ned Stark we see, there was no emotional connection. They should  have retained Sean Bean itself. Arya's been doing same shit again. Liked the Hound part, though. Why exactly Waif and Jaquen are trying to asses her relationship with Hound? This is the second time. Osha and Rickon - good to see them and sad to see poor shaggy dog. The betrayal of Umbers is not appealing and I don't care about Karstarks and Umbers. At this point of time in books, the only interesting and rooting plot line is the North. The show made it less interesting.The stretching should stop right now before it snaps instead of winding.  
s06e03	OMG the Tower of Joy flashback is moving so slowly!  Although I had to wonder:  what does it say about Ned that he could never tell the true story of how Sir Arthur Dayne died?  I have this feeling we'll see Ned walking down the stairs (with or without baby, depending) and not the room or Lyanna.  I get Bran's frustration, that's actually the most interesting story line right now.  The actor playing Bran is doing a terrific job with all of the nuances.The Arya storyline is moving along nicely and quicker than I feel it would have in past seasons.I get why Ollie hated Jon until the bitter end, plus I don't think that Jon would have been able to cut that rope had Ollie asked for forgiveness.  I don't think a single solitary person was surprised when he handed his cloak and said my watch is done.  At this point I'm going to say that I've either watched the episodes too many times or the program is becoming predictable?  Rickon delivered to Ramsay, Mellisandre resurrecting Jon, Jon walking away from the Wall with "my watch is over" ...  all seemed like the most obvious things to happen.Dani gets to the Khal-widow-group and is not readily accepted.  No time for a "Hey, my name is Dani and I've walked through fire.  You?" before she is stripped, put in a brown burlap sack and told that she is not automatically in and there will be meetings and votes and arguments about her.  She'll be plotting and scheming the whole time and my guess is that she'll end up with at least some Dothraki support.Rickon & Shaggydog, my heart is broken.  Hurry, Jon, hurry.Tyrion without dragons is boring now.  The Lannister twins may have overplayed their hands. No one seems very scared of them, or worried about offending them.  Tommen .... WTH was that about?  He's so impressionable, Jamie best start influencing that kid before the High Sparrow wins both Tommen & Margeary over.  I love Olenna and I love Olenna, most of all I love Olenna.  Please stay.  And that's my very first GoT review.  Hurry, Jon, you & Ghost need to hurry!
s06e03	Boring. Wasted an episode saying stuff we already knew. They didnt even show Lyanna in the Tower, the fight was hokie (Arthur Dayne used one famous sword not two, nobody dual wields long swords)Jon's resurrection is still being treated underwhelmingly even by him. He should should be freaking out. Only one person had a semi proper response to him being alive, the first traitor on the gallows.The only interesting thing was Umber returning Rickon, which is also stupid because the first thing Ramsay would do would be slit his throat.  If he doesn't its just a move to fill plot holes which is even worse.At least they brought Olenna back so now something might actually move along in Kings Landing instead of watching the wicked witch of the west pretend to have feelings.There's nothing even happening on the show this season that isnt surprising and the way they are beating square plot hole pegs thru round holes is starting to get tiresome.
s06e03	If GoT were an anime, this would be a filler episode. Dull, slow, and uninteresting.CAUTION: SPOILERS AHEAD!Not a single major revelation about all that has been left unsaid.They've pushed Lyanna to the next (maybe even further) episode.What is up with Jon "i-cant-do-this-job-anymore" Snow?!?The High Sparrow sure is sucking up to Tommen. That Cersei is planning to demand a trial-by-combat, is all we know.No significant plot progress with Daenerys either.When will Bran Stark start learning something?Gilly, Sam, and Sam Jr. are still traveling.The only point of interest that made me feel better is that Arya's eyes are back. Nonetheless, the possibility that Arya has finally accepted that she truly is "No One" . I liked Arya.I've got a very fishy feeling about Jon Snow, though. There's definitely more to him than he's letting on.
s06e03	I said this about the previous episodes, I will say it about this one.Nothing much happened. Or perhaps I'm wrong? Perhaps too much is happening, with not enough pomp to celebrate its import?There is a lot which I liked about this episode, but more that I didn'tTower of JoySer Arthur Dayne is fantastic! I have no idea why Ser Gerold Hightower wasn't there, but Arthur Dayne made up for it by singlehandedly handing half a dozen men their asses. Wonder why Jaime was never inspired to dual wield like Ser Dayne. He was the type...But the punchline was weak. With Eddard disarmed, Howland just stabs Dayne it the throat, and it's done. If that's all it took, Ned would have remembered it for us. Yes, I never thought Lyanna would be shown right now. There is a lot of power in that reveal, and no doubt the producers wanted to present it with deep impact. Not to mention, they must have been hoping to give GRRM as much time as they could before the big reveal. Bran is... progressing slowly, considering we've not seen him for over a year.Castle BlackTo quote Emperor Palpatine, "Everything is going as I had forseen". Here at least. Jon is shaken by his experience, and Kit Harrington has shown that vulnerable side well. His execution of the conspirators was very conspicuously different from last season's beheading. His "And now my watch is ended", while not wholly unexpected, throws a wrench in a lot of things. Like Edd. After all he went through, Jon abandons the Wall? What'll happen now? But the stage is being set for the Battle of the Bastards.Vaes DothrakIt always amazes me how Dany just... expects stuff to go her way all the time. Threatening the Dosh Khaleen, rattling off her many titles, like as though they mean something. Tywin laughs in his grave. Or his privy, whichever.King's LandingI do not think I have mentioned how disappointed I was with Jaime. Last season's Dorne arc was pathetic, but his tender moment with Myrcella right before her death made me hope for a better arc this time. I thought that the Riverlands arc would be better set up, with Jaime going there via Dorne. Taking names and kicking ass, before being set for his quest for redemption. Here he is with Cersei, still not ready to dump her ass. Cersei is vain vengeance personified as before. Everyone has acknowledged Frankengregor already. Good.  Tommen is trying to be strong. Doesn't look like he'll be succeeding anytime soon.The best part was when the Small Council walked out on Jaime and Cersei. Kevan is so going to die!BraavosArya is clearly not a Warg. But her skills are coming along in unexpected ways.WinterfellYes, everyone was right, and I was hoping there weren't. Umber presents Rickon to the Butcher of the Dreadfort. And Osha too. Why is she so special, I wonder? But what annoys me is that the Umbers were supposed to be with the anti Bolton camp. Or at least, reluctant Boltons. If the Karstarks and Umbers side with Ramsay, his prediction of the Manderlies doing so as well is probably spot on too. So much for the entertaining Lord Manderly's wedding feast.This season will start picking up next episode, I think. Or the Fifth episode, where each character ought to be set on their path for this season.
s06e03	Clearly the title Oath Breaker is a big give away to lot of story lines. First things first.Jon Snow is back after being dead, so he is no longer the Lord Commander and is free from NW duties. Probably few people like Alliser and Olly are going to die.By the preview video, Rickon Stark is going to be the gift for Ramsay Snow. Now oathbreaker would go to two story lines, maybe we get to see the scene where Jaime Lannistern kills the Mad King. Second is the scene at Tower of Joy. Ned is the oathbreaker because he raises a Targaryen kid whereas he has already knelt down to Robert baratheon.  Deanerys can also be the oathbreaker as she should have been at Vaes Dothrak.In any case,let's see. 6 hours to go! :D
s06e03	It was an episode with a scene, which I believe, everyone was looking forward to - The Tower of Joy.There were other scenes as well which were quite entertaining like The Beautiful Death of the False Brothers of the Night's Watch and Arya finally turning into no one.And yet, Tower of Joy was the one that stole the show.Finally, the readers and the viewers got to witness the face off between Ser Arthur Dayne - The Sword of the Morning and Eddard Stark. The scene was beautifully shot and action was mind-blowing! However, they did not introduce Dawn - the Valyrian steel sword of Arthur Dayne, which was a bummer.
s06e03	Oh come on people the show is great! I think people hating it are biased book readers. You all had an image in your head while reading the books and now want the show to be exactly like you've imagined. For people who hadn't read the books or all the spoilers and analysis all over the internet, this is the best show ever. 
s06e03	I think alot of people are going to betrade alot of people like for no i know for a fact the umbers are giving ramsey rickcon stark as the gife like rob stark said to the lord of the umbers i will label as a oathbreaker if u dont help me. I think now is the time they will have that laby 
s06e07	My review. :)Old Favourites Return And Uneasy Alliances Are Made In This Week's Fantastic Game Of Thrones - ED | The Youth Blog
s06e06	Yet another fantastic episode this season, if not so quite traumatic as last week's. Benjen  is back, Edmure  is back, Jaime and Brienne  are both headed to Riverlands, and Sam stole a Valyrian  steel blade from his prick of a father.Best of all, Arya  is out of that spooky death cult and is, hopefully, going to make her way back to Westeros. We didn't get any iron  islands, Jon or sansa  stuff this week, but that's ok.Before this episode  was little disappointed about Arya's storyline. But now.A girl has a name and a sword.
s06e06	1.Arya will not die for sure,since she has been ordered to kill. And that's not how characters die in GOT . They die unexpectedly.2.Khaleesi is connecting well with her dragon.3.Samwell taly will kill a white walker in near future since he has valyrian steel sword.4.Walder frey will continue to annoy everone.
s05e08	★★★★★It was phenomenal. Game of Thrones remains to be the most compelling show I've seen in quite some time. Tyrion and DanaerysTyrion has finally done what no man has dared to do before: Call out Jorah on being obviously and desperately in love with Dany. I think Tyrion was also correct in saying that Dany ought to allow him to live, because punishing subjects who love her doesn't exactly garner affection. However, Jorah is a liability, and his love for her has caused him to make some absolutely absurd choices and he's blinded by it. He's reached a point of being pathetic in his desperation to remain in her life, and I'm just waiting for her to have no choice but to kill him, since she's now spared him twice. Tyrion and Dany are well-matched, and their banter is fun to watch. I haven't found Dany to be a compelling leader for a few seasons now, and I'm hoping that Tyrion can show her the ropes and make her someone worth following. She's got a long way to go. Jorah later goes and sells himself back into slavery for no real reason, but he's also got nothing to lose since he was touched by the Stone Men.King's LandingKarma is in town, and is giving Cersei exactly what she deserves. Maybe it's just me, but her current fate was so predictable that I'm amazed she couldn't have seen it coming. The rumor that Cersei and Jamie are lovers seems to be spreading like wildfire and Cersei unleashed the religious zealots to punish people having "unnatural" sex. Considering the fact that she's been having sex with her brother for practically her entire life, you would think she'd want to keep more control over the Sparrows. I'll be interested to see where this goes. As Tyrion advised her last season, Cersei is not nearly as smart as she thinks she is. AryaI love seeing her character evolve. Maisie has become quite a strong actress since the first season. The idea is that Arya must lose/reject her identity, but I'm not sure I think she'll ever be able to commit fully to it. It's interesting to see the interactions between Jaquen and the other woman there who obviously has reservations about how quickly Arya is moving forward in the Game of Faces. I think it suits her, though. Her natural personality drives her to seek retribution for injustices. Jaquen having her learn about the thin man at the docks in order to ultimately kill him to restore the balance absolutely seems in line with what she seems to want to offer the world. There are still some people left on her Valar morghoulis list, and I want to know if she'll ever be able to complete the list since it becomes irrelevant if she's no longer Arya Stark. WinterfellDark Sansa is back and she's doing her best to regain control of her circumstances. The girl is nothing if not resilient. She only has a very brief scene, but she does discover that her brothers Bran and Rickorn are still alive...or at a minimum, they weren't killed by Theon. I'm hoping that Sansa sticks with Petyr's plan to claim the North and asks Brienne to track down the boys. Brienne needs a purpose, and I don't think she'll be useful to Sansa at all and her dramatic loyalty is only going to get Sansa and/or herself killed.The Boltons discuss war strategies with Stannis moving closer to trying to seize Winterfell. Right now, I think it's anyone's game. Ramsay is certifiably insane and I think he's rather arrogant about his abilities. He can torture people like a pro, but I'm not sure I'd expect his war tactics to be exceptional. Ramsay wants to take 20 good men and attack Stannis, and he expects to win. Roose would prefer to remain in Winterfell behind the safety of the walls. The scenes were short and didn't seem to matter much. Night's WatchSam and Gilly:Super cute...Super awkward. I don't trust Olly at ALL. He is asking all sorts of questions that make me seriously suspect that one day he's going to up and decide to try to kill Jon. Maybe it's just me, but that kid give me the creeps. Jon & Co. I can't even begin to describe how eerie Hardhome was. Every single moment was tense. The woman from Pitch Perfect 2 in Das Sound Machine showed up and played the Wildling woman with the kids she put in the boat and told Jon he needed to keep his word. It was a sweet moment, but I knew as soon as she put her kids in that boat that she wasn't making it out of there alive. When the Walkers suddenly show up, it was absolutely fascinating, and I can't help but feel that every single time they show up, the magic explaining them changes. The first time Sam runs into them on the glacier, they seem to be a hoard of zombies similar to the Walking Dead. Then in the woods with Gilly, all the crows show up just before the walker does. This time around, it seemed to be this ominous snow storm that preceded their arrival and they moved with ridiculous speed and ruthlessness, and once this ominous snow storm blew through and the Wildlings closed the gates, the hundreds of people on the wrong side of the gate seemed to disappear without a sound. I'd love some consistency and some explanation. Right now, I don't buy into their mythology and their portrayal because it changes so constantly. The net result of this venture to save the Wildlings is that they save a good number (though probably only about 25%) of the Wildlings there, the army of the (un)dead gained a TON of new members, Jon lost the dragonglass leaving them relatively defenseless, and Jon's sword (Valeryean steel) is evidently able to kill a Walker. You could feel the weight of this development during the episode, and I'm suspicious that it is another breadcrumb about Jon's parentage.Overall, a thrilling episode.
s05e08	★★★★★I love this episode, I love it, I love it! It has everything that makes Game of Thrones so exciting. It has Tyrion doing what he's best at, it has Arya becoming active again, it has heroic moments, terrifying images and important plot revelations. And it's not even episode 9 yet! So let's break it down again.Jorah and Tyrion have a meeting with the queen, where Tyrion has to convince Daenerys to let him stay as an advisor. She immediately asks him for advice on what's to be done with Ser Traitor. So on the one hand you have a dwarf from a family who murdered your own family, stole your throne, spied on you while you were in Essos and stands for everything you think is wrong with the world. On the other hand, you have a knight who made one little mistake, but who's devoted to you, saved your life multiple times and wants to truly help you with your cause. Who do you kick out? Do you even have to ask? :)Arya has finally proven herself worthy of getting her own mission. She has to gather intelligence on some guy who gambles with the lives of sea captains. This segment is told very well, with great narration from Arya and a lot of build-up. And it looks like Arya is starting to enjoy becoming an assassin.Cersei finds herself in a hard home of her own, as she's left to rot in the dungeons below Baelor's Sept. The Septa tries to make her confess by depriving her of food and water, and she finds out through Qyburn that help is hard to come by nowadays. Her uncle Kevan won't see her, her son Tommen doesn't want to see anyone, and Jaime is still far away. Seeing Cersei humiliated and helpless is kind of... gratifying, I must say.In the North, an angry Sansa confronts Theon over all his betrayals and asks him how he could do all those things, including murdering her brothers Bran and Rickon. Then Theon finally admits that it wasn't Bran and Rickon whom he killed. It's great to see Sansa finally getting some good news. Maybe that's why she's here in the North... to be reunited with her little brothers at one point.Meanwhile, the Boltons discuss tactics. Roose wants to dig themselves in in Winterfell, but Ramsay has a plan of his own. He wants 20 men to wreak havoc in Stannis's camp. You've gotta hand it to the guy: he really is like the Joker of Westeros. He's completely insane, and he's willing... to do... anything.While Jorah is selling himself back into slavery, Dany and Tyrion talk politics. It looks like they're getting along quite well, and Dany quickly appreciates his pragmatism and understanding of human nature. But she also makes it clear that she has no intention to suck up to this Lord or that Lord. She doesn't only want to stop the political wheel, she wants to break it.Gilly is attending to Sam's wounds from the previous episode, as Olly wants to have a word with him. He obviously has his doubts about the whole "let's bring the Wildlings to our side of the Wall" thing, and even starts to question his Lord Commander's judgement. Sam tries to convince him, but Olly is brooding a bit too much to my taste. I'm starting to get a bit worried that he might do something... drastic soon.Jon and Tormund get to Hardhome to meet with the Wildling leaders. They are greeted by the Lord of Bones, who immediately makes it clear that he has no intention of even listening to them. But Tormund is very good at driving the point home, and reduces the Lord of Bones to nothing but bones.Jon has a hard time convincing the Wildlings. Generations of distrust aren't easy to shrug off. But Tormund tells them how he stood up against Stannis and saved Mance from a painful death. That convinces at least a couple of leaders to trust Jon.But the other leaders soon find out what happens if they stay beyond the Wall, as the village is attacked by wights and White Walkers. A spectacular fight breaks out that's both creepy and epic. It shows bravery from both the Night's Watch and the Wildlings, and it introduces us to an awesome new character: the giant Wun Wun.Jon finds himself pitted against a White Walker, as he scrambles to find the dragonglass weapons. Failing to do so, he's forced to fend the attack off with nothing but his own sword. We expect the sword to shatter, as we have seen many other weapons shatter under the White Walker's blows. But amazingly enough, the sword holds, and Jon is able to kill the Walker with a single blow. But wait... I thought only dragonglass was able to harm White Walkers! Is Valyrian steel more powerful than we thought, or is there more to Jon than meets the eye? Does anyone hear the thundering sound of a plot point dropping?After losing hundreds of men, the Night's Watch and Wildlings make a hasty retreat to the ships and to the safety behind the Wall. We end the episode with a truly terrifying image of the Night's King himself, raising the fallen warriors to join his Army of the Death. Their previous fallen comrades are now wights, who will stop at nothing, cannot be negotiated with and only have one purpose: to destroy everything that's still alive.And so ends episode 8 on a very, very high note. This could have easily been an episode 9, but it seems we still have even more to top this. Still, I give this episode 5 stars, because this is exactly the episode I've been waiting for the whole season. I can't wait to see the epic conclusion in episode 9!
s05e08	★★★★★[This review contains spoilers]Easily the best episode of the season so far, it is once again the tale of two halves. The first half of the episode merely serves to move forward the storyline in several arcs:I was rather pleased to see Tyrion's negotiation strategy in action. He sizes up Daenerys, and demonstrates his knack for handling delicate issues, serving up several witty one-liners in the process. Dany, on her part, lets Tyrion know that she intends to rule as an autocrat and not through a coalition, before deigning to let him serve as her Hand.Banished yet again and with a painful death looming large, Jorah makes a desperate bid to reclaim lost honor and glory by enrolling himself in the fighting pits. While the show might serve us some more Gladiator-style visuals of Jorah fighting in the pits only to have him die a hero's death, I really hope they don't. There are far more interesting things happening on the show to let Jorah take up too much screentime in the last two episodes.It was a real relief to see Sophie Turner looking a lot less battered in this episode. Sansa also learns that her younger brothers are still alive, and with Ramsay all set to take some time off from his daily routine of domestic abuse to lead a daring raid on Stannis' camp, this episode gives Sansa more good news than the last few seasons combined.Arya's assassin arc isn't half as interesting as I thought it would be. Nevertheless, she seems to have gained enough of Jaqen's trust to be handed her first target -- an unscrupulous Insurance salesmen. Here too, I hope things pick up pace a bit and that Arya quickly moves back to her primary targets, or whichever few of them are left anyway.Prison doesn't agree with Cersei, and it's sort of sad seeing her in such a pitiable state. I think Qyburn's goodbye "the work continues" was some sort of silver lining intended to tell her that Mountain 2.0, on whom Qyburn has been experimenting in secret, is reaching the state that Cersei had in mind. I'm sure this plays some role in the next couple of episodes, but can't yet figure out what.Sam and Gilly have a more-sweet-than-awkward morning after up until they're interrupted by young Olly. It makes sense that Olly hates the wildlings and dislikes Jon for wanting to shelter them, but as Sam seems to have finally convinced him of, they have no other choice. They need every single person they can gather on their side, and even that might not be enough.HardhomeThe Magheramorne Quarry* that was turned into the set for Hardhome looks spectacular, and gives you the chills right from the moment Jon reaches ashore.After making an example out of the Lord of Bones and showing the other Wildling lords that he means business, Tormund leads Jon into a meeting with the elders. There, Jon quickly gives them the speech he's practiced enough by now, and manages to rally most of them to his side. Things seem to be going well. The Wildling lord, played by Danish actor Birgitte Hjort Sørensen, makes quite an impression but you know something's about to go wrong when she promises her doe-eyed children that she's right behind them. But even the most prescient amongst us non-book-readers couldn't have predicted the source of her ill-fate.The cold winds descend upon Hardhome and the reaction of its inhabitants tells us that they're about to be hit by something more ominous than an avalanche. And boy, do they get hit! Hungry wights charge down upon every human, as Jon, Tormund and the others desperately try to reduce the damage. In a visual illustration of Jon's earlier point about the need for the living to be united, a Thenn who was earlier obstinate in his opposition of the Crows fights by their side to try and disrupt the march of the undead. Just as they seem to holding their own against the wights, the camera pans to a grim shot of some mounted White Walkers overseeing the chaos. After a frenetic fight with one of these Walkers, Jon realizes that he's armed with a weapon far more powerful than he'd imagined. The small victory Jon gains here however offers him little respite as the waves of Wights force all the battle commanders to flee the scene of battle before any more lives are lost. Even the knowledge that his sword kills White Walkers loses its significance when we see the ease with which the Lead(?) White Walker resurrects the newly-dead to further strengthen his army of Wights.The direction of the Hardhome scenes was immaculate. The brilliant soundtrack helps build up the tension and keeps you on edge throughout the battle, and the eerie lack of it amplifies the sense of doom at the end. The last few minutes literally gave me goosebumps.How are we supposed to care about the petty machinations of King's Landing and elsewhere after we just witnessed that? How will anyone stop these White Walkers and their army of Wights? I guess at least for the latter question, we'll have to wait till next season to find out.*This entire glorious set was probably built for just this episode. Viewers who want to get some more details about what went into its conceptualization and creation can watch this documentary released before the start of this season.
s05e08	★★★★★5 stars is not enough! Give this episode an Oscar, if possible! At least a Golden Globe?What a breath-taking and scintillating episode - the scariest few minutes of GoT ever. Winter has come, truly.The 59:58 long show was music to ears, feast to the eyes and a treat to the yearning mind after a few passive build-ups muddled with errors. Ever heard of a verbattle or button poetry? This one is constructed over dialogues that felt like words ringing through my head as though it was everything, the final move. No more moves and counter-moves. This is it!The Tyrion-Dany and Arya-Jaqen dialogues were beautifully written especially the first. It felt like a reunion of two similar people, one an alter ego of other as they sit and have a discourse on why they should join hands.Arya is ready as well, whether House of Black and White ready ? we don't know. But she is going for her kill and Jaqen seems to carve her future storyline. I cannot refrain from saying this - How pretty she looked in the harbor! It's been a while since I've seen Arya so dressed up. Come to think of it, never! Cersei's misery continues, though she still has hopes in Qyburn. The Septas are doing their bit in making it worse. Big question is when will Cersei break and confess.Reek (Theon)'s inadvertent slip leaves Sansa with the truth that he did not kill Bran and Rickon. This may open a few doors and compel Sansa to take decisions far beyond  those of just being a pretty woman in the house. Will Sansa take back Winterfell - another big question with so many ifs and buts!The rest is drowned by fear and nail-biting events that take place when Jon tries to save the Wildlings. This was the second time since reading the first chapter of A Game of Thrones (Benjen Stark and the rangers) did I feel the chill of the Others. It was accompanied by the sheer trepidation of the other Others. I wasn't wrong.The power, the number, the strength witnessed first time in scale by the Night's Watch - stunning! I can't wait to see what Jon's next move would be!Can't wait, but the Winter has come!
s05e08	★★★★★I've got to agree with every other review here. This episode was spectacular! I'll get to the best part last.Cersei's comuppance is superbly made. It's not over, obviously. As viewers, we can tell that she's going to be driven to madness soon and her only chance of escape is to confess. She knows it too, but it remains to be seen if she will confess or if Qyburn or Jaime find some way to rescue her. The scene where she licks water off the floor is savagely triumphant. Sansa is not miserable and weak, yay! She's holding her head proud and instead of begging Theon to help her, tells him that she would have done exactly what Ramsay did to him. Good for you, Sansa. Reek -- no, Theon -- no, Reek -- lets slip that Bran and Rickon could still be alive. While this offers a great deal of hope for Sansa and a reason for her to escape, it raises two big questions: 1. If the Boltons find out, will Sansa be affected because there is now a male heir to Winterfell, and most importantly, 2. Reek let slip a little bit of Theon outside when he talked about the two boys. Does this mean Theon could slowly escape out of Reek and maybe even help Sansa escape out of Winterfell?  Ramsay, meanwhile, seems to think he can bring Stannis's army down with just twenty men. He has a point when he says that the cold is the Bolton's home but not Stannis's. However, with barely twenty men... I'm curious to see what savagery he is going to be up to. Arya's scenes were perfect! The color, the marketplace, Jaqen, and Arya's first assignment. Faceless Men are contract killers. This man cheats families out of insurance money, and now Arya has been hired to kill him. Her arc is going to get super awesome. Tyrion establishes and reestablishes that he can talk his way out of and into anything. Jorah Mormont seems to be getting desperate to the point of being repulsive, but Dany has now found in Tyrion a well equipped advisor. Their conversations about their respective fathers and families were extremely well written. The best lines always go to Tyrion. Clarke and Dinklage share a pleasant chemistry on screen and look almost natural. I was very surprised at how comfortable Tyrion and Dany seemed. I would have expected Dany to be a little wary of Tyrion in terms of her body language, but the guy has some wits and an equally powerful tongue. I am praying that they never end up in bed, though. Eww. At the Wall, Olly talks to Sam about the wisdom behind Jon's rationale. This scene serves as a stark reminder that though Jon is proved right at Hardhome, back in Castle Black, not everyone agrees with him. Jon now has all of the 5000 odd wildlings on his side, but probably not all of the Brothers. And that's not going to be easy for him at all. At Hardhome... it feels unjust to even describe it. These twenty minutes have to be seen. Jon has a hard time convincing the Magnar of Thenn to come over on his side, but the White Walkers arrive with their wights just in time to prove him right. An interesting and useful reveal is that Valyrian Steel (which is different from dragonglass / obsidian) is also effective against White Walkers. And now the Watch knows it, and that's something the enemy knows.Valyrian Steel comes from the same place as dragonglass, of course: the dragonfires of Valyria. Old Valyria is where Mormont and Tyrion were attacked by the Stone Men. There was one other Valyrian Steel sword we knew of: Ice, belonging to Ned Stark. Obviously, there's a reason why Northeners end up with Valyrian Steel. It was reforged into two blades that were given to Joffrey and Jaime each. Joffrey's is in his coffin and Jaime's is with Brienne now, and that's something to be remembered. Tyrion also has a dagger made of Valyrian Steel. Or he does in the books. My brain is trying to make connections left, right, and center.Will Jon reach out to the rest of the mainland for all the Valyrian Steel they can provide? No one would want to part with it, of course. The metal is legendary. Will Jon be welcomed back a hero at Castle Black? Word of the White Walkers should have reached before he does. Are the Brothers and the Wildlings going to be slitting each others' throats when the wights advance on the Wall? The next couple of episodes are sure to be even more interesting.One more important thing to note is that the Night's King looked at Jon destroying the White Walker. This guy was the one who converted Craster's baby into a ... whatever, from last season. We know that the Night's King was a Lord Commander himself. Book readers should be making some connection here regarding how ADwD ended.  Also, this is my new favorite GIF after the one showing Drogon rising. Ice and Fire, y'all.
s05e08	★★★★(4.5/5)Brilliant episode. I love how the White Walkers and the wights were portrayed.The wights appeared to be more like pawns of the chessboard, while the White Walkers were the more important pieces. While the mindless wights showed all the grace and charm of an octopus on roller skates, the White Walkers were in contrast, quite elegant and impressive. But both, equally terrifying. That's what caught my interest.The background score used in the last scene was absolutely perfect. I loved how the music ended with one of the newly made wights opened their eyes. Really sent a chill down my spine. A perfect way to establish that the long nights are coming. And the dead, with it; as said by Jon Snow.Removing half star for Dany's cheesy dialogue "I'm going to break the wheel". Forget the dialogue, Emilia Clarke didn't do it right either.
s05e08	★★★★★Summary thoughts:One of the best episodes of TV I've ever watched, alongside the Red Wedding.The fight with the Others was crazy good -- as well-done / scary / awesome as a solid action movie.The action was nicely counterbalanced with the Danerys / Tyrion dialogue, which felt like years in the making and was really fun. Great to see Tyrion conversational and smart again -- as opposed to drunk and helpless.
s05e08	★★★★★In my opinion, it's the best GOT episode so far:1. Cersei finally gets what she deserves.2. The "terrible children"s exchanges (this relationship may finally bring some sanity into the show).3. One of the most badass battle ever in a tv show. (from unexpected start to epic stare-down at the end)Also, if you care about metrics, this episode is the highest rated GOT episode on imdb with an insane 9.9/10 ("Game of Thrones" Hardhome (TV Episode 2015)) and 100% on rotten tomatoes ( Page on rottentomatoes.com ).
s05e08	Game of Thrones Season 8 Episode 5 is all set to air on Sunday, the 12th of May at 9 PM ET and 6 PM PT. This will be the penultimate episode in the final season of GoT and is expected to set the stage for a grand finale. The events of the fourth episode of the show have already hyped things up and we await the fifth episode eagerly!Let us take a closer look at the show and all that we expect from it.Game of Thrones Season 8 Episode 5 ReviewThe upcoming episode of Game of Thrones will feature all-out action. This will be the episode where Daenerys and Greyworm will avenge the murder of Missandei. We see in the teaser for the episode that Euron is looking at something and his eyes are wide open. We can only assume he is looking at Daenerys riding Drogon attacking his fleet.In this episode, Bran’s vision of a dragon flying over King’s Landing will also come true as it would be Dany storming through the city.What else to Expect from the episode?This episode of the show will also feature Cleganebowl where Sandor Clegane (the hound) will face off with his brother Gregor Clegane (the mountain). This is also likely to be the episode where Cersei Lannister and Euron Greyjoy will meet their end.The real dynamic here would be between Dany and Jon Snow and who would finally rule on the iron throne.
s05e08	★★★★★I really enjoyed this episode. Especially the battle at Hardhome. Everything was so well done. You can definitely tell where the budget went for this season. I don't know how the next 2 episodes can compare, especially since they almost always save battle scenes that are this good for the penultimate episodes. This has made up for the previous episodes having little or no action.
s05e10	★★★It was underwhelming with at least ten plot holes, but it wasn't bad at all! I watched the whole thing at 2x speed, and managed to understand exactly what the show creators are going for. I do have a lot of complaints that I will weave into this post. On the positive side, this episode has left us with the most  cliffhangers ever. Is Myrcella dead? Is Stannis dead? Are Sansa and  Theon dead? IS JON SNOW DEAD? I thought for a moment that it was  probably over done, but I surprisingly liked all the suspense. It was an  apt way to close the season: suspense for both the readers and the  viewers. First and foremost, hats off to Lena Headey! The walk of atonement was beautifully made. Although they filmed with a body double and barely five people on set, the entire walk was believable, real, and traumatic. Headey's expressions were superb. But I felt, that both Stephen Dillane (Stannis) and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime) had dropped some points with their acting. All of the scenes involving the two of them felt forced and over rehearsed (or under rehearsed, I don't know). But back to KL, how is Cersei not being charged with the murder of Robert? That was the main reason why she was arrested, wasn't it? Lancel talks of their relationship AND the wine he was made to feed Robert. I guess she's going to have a trial where that comes up. And considering her new aide, we can be sure there's another demand for trial by combat in the next season. Although I have no idea how such a large cavalry could be accomodated inside of Winterfell, Stannis made a huge stupid move to lay seige. Of course he wasn't going to win. What was he thinking? But I have a big BIG complaint about the Battle at Winterfell. WHERE WAS THE BATTLE? They had been building up to this the whole season! And they didn't as much show as a clash of swords! There was a lot of noise while Boltons pounce on Stannis, and suddenly Stannis is barely able to walk. It's outrageous. Even stranger was Stannis subjecting himself to Brienne like that. It was very out of character for him. It was a triumphant moment for Brienne, but it was hardly believable because it came and went so quick before it could even register. And Melisandre just rode back to Castle Black? That's akin to deserting her king and very out of character for her, even if she suddenly did stop believing in Stannis. I'm very glad to see Theon finally break free of Reek. Sure, in their desperation, they jumped down a fifty feet wall, but I'm hoping Sansa and Theon are alive next season. Also, did anyone notice that Sansa is now a nearly spitting image of Catelyn Stark? The other Stark girl was awesome, as usual. The gory, bloody butchering was a treat to the mind. However, I have two very specific problems with the Arya story. One, why was Meryn Trant made out to be such a disgusting child abuser/rapist/whatever? I hate the fact that D&D take the villians to such caricatures when they want us to side with the "good ones": be it Arya or Tyrion or Dany, the bad guys are so evil and bad in such a larger than life way, you can't help but think these three are heroes and saviors. I hate that. They aren't. All three of them are cold hearted and Arya is a cold hearted killer, and it should be shown that way. This is not a good triumphs over evil story. Arya hated him for killing Syrio Forel and that should be enough. Two, how did she learn how to use the faces? More importantly, how did she see her own face and Jaqen's? Ok, granted maybe Jaqen's face belonged to someone who is dead and is simply used by this guy, how can Arya's face be on the body? The faces are physically cut off dead people. That's why Arya spent so much time cleaning bodies. Was it magic? If yes, was it magic that caused her to go blind? In the books, she drinks a potion that causes blindness, but it wasn't so here. They can do magic now and cast illusions at the House of Black and White? Gah. Dany is found by a khalasar. She is flown all the way to the Dothraki sea and found by people who probably already know her. But man, was that scene long! Even at 2x speed, the men whirring around Dany kept going on and on and on. I suppose that was for the viewers' benefit -- to remember the Dothraki and how violent they are and how Dany could be in trouble now. So.. Tyrion and Grey Worm and Missandei are going to be taking care of Mereen's administration now. That made me snort. We've heard over and over again how Westeros is NOT like Essos, so I don't see how Tyrion can help. We know that Dany, being a woman, is powerful only because of her dragons. So I don't know how Missandei is going to help. We also know that the Unsullied are subservient fighters who are taught to fight or die. They are not trained in administration or ruling whatsoever. Plus, Grey Worm is castrated and the common folk aren't going to respect that. So I don't know GW is going to help. Worst of all, none of these three can even dream of going near the dragons and the common folk know that very well. Bad decision. Desperate decision, maybe, but bad decision nevertheless. Oh and the Missandei/Grey Worm subplot really irks me too. There's no point to it. It looks like the two will end up dying together some time in the future. Dorne. I've hated Dorne since the season began. A Sand Snake -- a terrifying deadly killer of a woman -- is whispering dirty words into Bronn's ears. Dafuq. As if last week's slapping game wasn't enough. Oh, and what was the point of killing Myrcella after Trystane got a seat on the Small Council?? Jaime then talks about how you can't choose who you fall in love with. Ugh. Really? Nothing that happened in Dorne made any sense. Absolutely nothing. Sure, Ellaria Sand wanted revenge, but surely she isn't so foolish that she doesn't realize that Jaime can just turn the ship around and accuse her? And then she would get thrown into jail with her daughters and there will be a full blown war. It makes no sense. However, it gave us yet another cliff hanger. Is Myrcella dead? Finally, Jon Snow. I liked this scene. I know there was no buildup to it, and there wasn't even a valid enough reason (umm hello, White Walkers are coming and everyone knows that!), but it was made well. It was unexpected and painful. But where is Ghost?Lastly, what's with the title of the episode? Was that a deliberate way to troll readers about LSH? Is there even going to be LSH? This season felt like a forced list of shocking moments that D&D checked off their list, and forcefully built the story around. Half the plots in this season made no sense, but I still liked this episode because each of those mini cliff hangers were evocative of the Red Wedding. And this season has ended on the same note for both the book readers and the viewers.
s05e10	★★★★★The season 5 finale of Game of Thrones is unlike anything we've seen before, riding on the coattails of two previously top-notch episodes and creating a suspenseful, emotional roller coaster throughout all 60 minutes. Although I wouldn't say it was the most coherent episode and left many questions unanswered, the condensation of world-changing events in this single episode infest viewers with sheer bewilderment--a novel element long lost to genre-conforming television.SPOILERS AHEAD: PROCEED WITH CAUTION.WinterfellThe futility of Stannis' mission to conquer the North finally hits home with Queen Selyse's death, placing the viewer right alongside Stannis' torn psyche. Brienne's direct conflict with Stannis at his last breath interestingly parallels the two most persistently stubborn characters of the show. It not only offers the values they fight for but cuts at the vital moment--begging the question: Is Stannis really dead?Theon is back baby! I was in tears watching Theon peel away the disgusting skin of Reek away to rescue Sansa in her most desperate time. I was reminded of Theon's camaraderie to the Starks, even if he was at heart a Greyjoy. Again, the creators cut at the vital moment (damn you, stop teasing me) to offer the possibility that Sansa and Theon make it out alive.BraavosThere is nothing more satisfying (and disgusting to know that you are satisfied by it) than to revel at the death of someone you hate on screen. Yet I did. Arya Stark so coldly killed the sadist pedophile Meryn Trant that I almost cried tears of joy.However, her punishment reminds us that the God of Death has rules that need to be followed, alluding to Arya's inevitable extended training period to prove herself as.... no one.DorneAlthough Cersei may be repulsive to viewers, Jaime Lannister has redeemed himself past his sister-fucking reputation to be known as a noble hero in his own right. That's why his candid discussion with his daughter Myrcella about their connection felt as heartwarming as it was strange. In any character's arc, it is these small moments that make us understand and sympathize with characters even further. I have to applaud the consistency of the show for this.And yet... Vipers don't die quietly. As sad as I felt for the death of an innocent girl, I felt happy that revenge was done right on account of my dear favorite Oberyn Martell (RIP). Damn you, Game of Thrones, for making me take sides!MeereenI am ecstatic to see how Tyrion roars at the politics of a city in Essos, as he so brilliantly did in Westeros at King's Landing (Season 2). I am made even more excited with the return of Varys, the clever "Master of Whisperers". It is a crucial, politically-driven season in the making and I cannot wait.Somewhere in the middle of nowhereReally? You're going to end on a cliffhanger for Daenerys too? Oh well, on we ride.King's LandingCersei's walk of shame was perhaps the most uncomfortable scene I've ever witnessed on television... in this season. Director David Nutter (who directed Season 3 Episode 9 by the way) does a phenomenal job of making us feel sorry for the most hated character in Game of Thrones.Not to fear though, it ends with the much anticipated ZOMBIE MOUNTAIN, who carries her out, into redemption? Or another scheme? If the burning questions in my body all consolidated, I fear I may spontaneously combust faster than Lady Melisandre's victims! Too soon? Sorry.Castle BlackNo words. The use of Olly's character to add flame to the fire with that final stab was such an unexpected yet well placed turn that leaves me pining for the return of my sanity.And now his watch is ended?We'll have to wait 10 months to find out.
s05e10	★★An okay-ish end to a terrible season.Tread carefully, there be spoilers ahead (from the books too)!Despite all the hype surrounding the episode that it was supposed to "break the internet", what we saw tonight hardly even made a dent. While the finale does manage to neatly tie-off all the story arcs that were explored this season, it was nonetheless not even close to being as impactful as the others.1. (I've ranted enough in last episode's review about how D&D have never understood Stannis and/or his motivations and that they've presented their own biased views of him to show-only audiences, so I'm not going to harp on that again.)As a continuation of the last episode we see that the Shireen-bonfire party did have the intended effect - the snows-are-a-thawing; but now half of Stannis' men have deserted him. Who would have thought that might happen? It's not like Stannis was the best military commander in the Seven Kingdoms. Oh, wait.Expanding on that,Random Soldier: Your Grace, we're nearing Winterfell, wouldn't it be wise to send scouts ahead? Are you sure? Well, okay then.And to top it off, we have an infuriatingly nonexistent take on what happens next. The last we see of Stannis, he is exposed right at the front of his vanguard with the Bolton Army about five times his numbers charging against him (on horseback, mind you - while Stannis has none), flanking both sides while a third of his army is deserting from the rear. And he not only survives R'hllor knows how many charges, but lives long enough to kill two more of Ramsay's leftover men while being severely injured just so that Brienne could finish him off? That's a paddlin'.Meanwhile elsewhere Ramsay's killing off stragglers just for shits and giggles. And speaking of Ramsay, I'm getting tired of the "untouchable bad guy" thing they've got going on for him. And now that he's lost Myranda, Reek/Theon and Sansa in one sweep, his reaction would have been something to look forward to if only there had been someone (Stannis) to take advantage of his rashness in a military strategy.2. In Braavos, we finally see what Meryn-too-old-Trant does with his little pre-teen tea party guests. Despite hating the show-only extra incentive to wanting him dead, I actually loved t(his) execution. The killing was reminiscent of the Tickler's multiple stabbing (AFfC), Oberyn's gouged eyes and Catelyn's throat swipe, and it achieved the intended effect of vengeance served on a cold platter. And while Arya's arc has deviated the least from the books, the merging of Raff the Sweetling and Dareon into Trant helped segueing the story back to where it was supposed to be and that's a plus for the show.3. Cersei's Walk of Atonement was hard to watch. I never thought I'd feel pity for her but I have to admit - I did. And what with the entry of Ser Robert Strong and the casting news looking for a character matching the description of a certain Septon next season, I'm all aboard the hype train for Cleganebowl 2016!5. At Dorne, apart from the awfully cringeworthy "bad pussy" line from Tyene, we have a truly heart-warming father-daughter moment between Jaime and Myrcella. But of course such trifles do not last long, doubly so in Game of Thrones. On the bright side Ellaria does stay true to what Oberyn said back in the last Season:We do not harm little girls in Dorne.and to what Doran warned her about back in the second episodeWe do not mutilate little girls, not here.Technically, the poison took effect on International Waters, so Ellaria and the Sand Snakes have got that going for them; although by doing so, not only have they enraged the Crown (when word of this reaches King's Landing) but they've also handed over a hostage in the form of Trystane who is also Doran's heir, so I don't exactly know what Ellaria was thinking, if at all.6. The Meereen arc would have been next to useless with all the petty squabbling if not for the reentry of Varys back into the picture. It will be interesting to see how Tyrion and his old comrade handle the upcoming civil war now that Daenerys isn't there any longer to add wildfire to the dragonflame.7. At the Wall, I'm glad they're following Sam's journey to Oldtown. Although in this case, I don't exactly know how I feel about Sam himself suggesting the idea - does it show a better, less-craven Sam? Doesn't this go against what little we heard of Randyll Tarly earlier this season? I'm conflicted about this, but glad they're not skipping that whole arc.8. For the Watch!: This was it - the reason why book readers were eager to watch the episode - if not just to put some theories to rest. I'll admit - using the Benjen bait and switch for roping us book-readers in was a clever (read cheap) piece of advertising. I immediately felt stupid when I realized what was going to happen when Olly came up to Jon with news about his uncle. And as far as the actual "For the Watch" is concerned, while it was perfectly in line with what happens in the books, I think they went overboard turning it into some kind of a ceremony what with making a sign-board marked "Traitor" and all that just for this one occasion while they should be worrying about getting hold of Valyrian swords to fight an army of the undead at their doorstep.Overall, this season has been the weakest link in the series so far. All this, when D&D had the source material ready at hand to refer to. I can only imagine what they're going to do from here on. The way things are going, I'm no longer worried about the show spoiling the books for me.
s05e10	★★★A Weak Season Finale.The most important highlight of this season to me was deviation from the books and plot conveniences - this episode succinctly describes this point. Another highlight has been degradation of the elements that made us feel how real this world of fantasy was.Quickly going over the plots that have ended on a cliffhanger/left us wondering:Dany is surrounded by a Khalasaar - although we don't know if they know who she is. Also, boy does the Dothraki sea look different from what we saw in the first season! For once, I thought Dany landed in Westeros - probably the place where they filmed Brienne and Hound's fight.Theon and Sansa are literally left halfway on their jump - what was their motivation apart from breaking all the bones? It looks Sansa had a plan to escape but was Theon an accomplice all along? Not much is revealed here.Arya is blinded. To be honest, Meryn Trant's assassination was seriously some PG stuff, reminded me of Oberyn's death scene. That girl is way too vengeful.Cersei's walk of shame was pretty much satisfying. However now, the gold cloak have Ser Robert Strong on their side (since he's risen from dead you can't kill it, unless in this case, you chop its head off). When will the trial take place we can only anticipate. Also, we see  the gradual fulfilment of Magi the witch's prophecy - Myrcella dies from a kiss of death.Jon is stabbed, but did he warg? Did he or did he not?  [Please stop circulating fake images on the web.]There were other small plots: Jorah and Daario set off on an expedition to find Dany, while Varys reaches Mereen to find himself assisting Tyrion - the only two characters whose conversations sound interesting to listen.And now, the one big plot that has ended: Stannis' claim to the Iron throne and the Battle for Winterfell is over - what an anticlimax! Stannis didn't even stand a chance. It was only logical that the Sellswords deserted after Shireen's sacrifice  but I seriously don't believe they took away all the horses - not a single horse in his army left? And how is it that Stannis, one of the best generals of Westeros, has no fucking idea what's going on with his troops?  This is what happens when you first deviate from the books but inevitably return back to tie the loose ends. This undoubtedly gets the award for 'the most unsatisfactory end to a plotline ever'.
s05e10	★★★★Well, Episode 10 was a worthy finale that brought the developments of the entire season to the proper conclusions. After the shock of Episode 9, Episode 10 was nothing but satisfaction to me. Let's break it down again.People who were outraged by Stannis' decision in last episode will probably rejoice at the start of this one. Stannis is having the worst day ever as everything around him turns to absolute shit. He loses half of his men, his wife and his spiritual guide in a span of 5 minutes. In the end, he does recognize that forward is still the only way to go, so he still decides to march on to Winterfell and take on the Boltons.Jon is having a heartfelt talk with his buddy Sam, because he has to share his experiences at Hardhome with someone. Sam asks him why he doesn't tell the other Brothers what happened. Yeah, Jon, why don't you? They might be a little more understanding about it if they'd know how big a threat the White Walkers really are. Oh well, it's probably one of those "you had to be there" stories.Also, Sam asks Jon for permission to leave for Oldtown to become a maester, because he feels he can be of more use in that capacity. Let's hope we can see more of him next season, because Oldtown seems like a very interesting place.Meanwhile, Sansa decides it's finally time to call in the cavalry, and she lights a candle in the Broken Tower. But in Stark fashion she's just one moment too late, because Brienne has already received the news of Stannis' arrival at Winterfell. She decides avenging her beloved Renly is worth more than the oath that brought her there. So she turns away 10 seconds before the window is lit.The battle between Stannis and the Boltons is shorter than he thought. The Boltons decide that it isn't even worth to have Stannis besiege them. They just ride out and decimate his army. Stannis manages to fight off some soldiers, but then succumbs to his wounds just as Brienne finds him. He confesses his sins to her and she sentences him to die. And ironically, she uses Oathkeeper to execute him, just after she broke her oath to Sansa to get to Stannis.Fortunately for Sansa, she finds an unlikely hero in Theon. He kills Miranda for her and then helps her escape from Winterfell. Finally some redemption in his arc! And Alfie Allen is Awesome As Always :).Arya decides to go forward on her mission. Posing as a young brothel girl, she manages to finish Ser Meryn Trant in a rather gruesome way.But she finds out that there's a price to pay for deciding for yourself who lives and who dies. A disappointed Jaqen explains to her that the faces in the House of Black and White are meant for people who are truly no one. They are poison for people who don't understand them completely. And with that, Arya loses her eyesight completely.Speaking of poison... the altered "Dornish Master Plan" turns out to be not so good for Myrcella Baratheon. Ellaria Sand gives her a final kiss before she departs Dorne with her dad... but it turns out it was a poisonous kiss. And just as Jaime was finally looking forward to being a real dad, he's got a dead daughter at his feet. Yeah, great job at protecting her, Jaime!In Meereen, Daenerys' small council decides what to do now that she took off with her dragon. Jorah and Daario are definitely riding out to look for her, and Tyrion wants to come, too. But after a nice "what are YOU good for?" talk, they decide that Tyrion should rule the city with Missandei and Grey Worm.While this may be a bit of a bummer for Tyrion, it's actually not so bad when he sees an old friend again. Tyrion and Varys, deciding the fate of Meereen. Now that's going to be interesting in season 6!Drogon brought Daenerys back to the north of the Dothraki sea. But she can't get him to bring her back to Meereen, as he's acting like a big baby. Their scenes together are very well done CGI-wise, I must say. Much better than the fighting pit scenes in last episode. She interacts with Drogon very naturally, but that's actually very hard to accomplish with CGI.After her argument with the dragon, she sets out to look for food. But after only taking a few steps, she gets surrounded by a Dothraki khalasar. Well, always nice to see some familiar faces... right?Cersei reaches her low point after she's forced to confess her adultery with Lancel. She's stripped naked and forced to take a Walk of Attonement. For me, the most uncomfortable part in this scene wasn't the walk itself, but the part where they cut her hair. Cersei always had beautiful, long hair. Cutting it off really symbolizes how her power and dignity were cut off from her.But new hope arrives for her in the form of the latest addition to the King's Guard: Ser Robert Strong, a.k.a. Ser FrankenMountain. That's always handy in case she'd ever need someone, like... be her champion in a Trial by Combat or something? :)Melissandre makes it back to the Wall and is greeted by a worried Davos. It's too bad that the showrunners don't really take time to show his reaction to what happened to Shireen. The question what Davos makes of everything that has happened is still unanswered. So his character will probably become way more interesting next season.Finally, we see Jon being set up for his downfall. And kudos to the person who asked if Uncle Benjen Stark would still make an appearance this episode. It was clear that Olly would be a part of the betrayal, but I'm actually glad that the Night's Watch did it as a group effort. I want to take a moment to applaud young Brennock O'Connor for his portrayal of conflicted Olly in season 4 and 5. He lost everything in season 4, found something to believe in this season, and then lost everything again when the man he put all his trust in sides with the people who murdered his whole family. "Et tu, Olly?" "Yeah, sorry. You know nothing, Jon Snow."And so the episode ends with an image of a very dead Jon Snow. He's not warging, he's not rising from the grave... he too, is a dead Stark now. The real question is: could Melissandre do anything about that? And if she does, will that finally release Jon from the Night's Watch to become an active player in the Game of Thrones? Or will he be risen by the Others to become a commander in their army? We don't know, but I'm pretty sure his part hasn't ended yet.ConclusionEpisode 10 is a great way to end a season with very high and very low points. The Dorne-storyline was a huge disappointment and the way Stannis met his downfall was despised by many. But the political changes in King's Landing were very interesting, Tyrion's storyline in Essos is promising and Hardhome was unbelievably good. Overall, I'm glad I watched this season and I'm looking forward to next year, where the story will probably continue on his own without help from the books. Until then: valar morghulis! :)
s05e10	★★A pretty mediocre end at a below average season.First of all I will start with Danny ,she is making real progress , increasing her leadership skills but she is in a galaxy far far away...how far? Who knows ? Depends on how many books they want to write. Now she is taken even further somehow ( though she drops a ring so they will find her...hell even with cellphones I could not find anyone but they will find a ring in a field). The rest of her team are magically alive and have to deal with ISIS . BTW how come the greatest soldiers getting killed by people with knives or why they are STILL using spears in narrow alleys beats me.Stannis stannis stannis....well he is the most accomplished military commander between all the throne suitors...wait has he won a battle or even made a rational decision ever?He killed his daughter and expected his army to fight for him? Does not matter anyways,probably Bolton could have killed everyone single handedly, he even sabotaged a military camp because "northerns know the terrain better" ,probably used the vents to get through or the sewer system oh wait there was not any.Btw he have been killed.Cersei , I hated her from episode one but for six minutes I had to see her walking around because  Isis  wanted her to.Hey I can see a pattern...Back in Joffreys day he would imprison them,have let them resort to cannibalism, see who survived and take them champion in order to draw a blood eagle on his back but hey they have become powerful because Marx -srry I meant high sparrow is righteous. Oh we also have clegane as a zombie.Myrcella -cute- Lannister gets murdered ,maybe...maybe not ...who cares boring arch...Arya gets revenge on the shiny armor guy ,who just like to torture young girls, using the holy grace...or magic...which learns to use because of washing corpses...obviously. I enjoyed the gore of this scene i have to say. Sansa stark decides to jump from the highest place she can find...John snow is also stabbed....it is getting ridiculous.... No build up or time to swallow what happened... Stuff just happens...no reason and WAY TOO MANY cliffhangers, srry lost interest in ALL of them.Rushed ending for a rushed season.
s05e10	★★★Well, that concludes Season 5. A mediocre episode that somehow managed to portray most of the cliffhangers from the last two published books.Spoilers if you haven't watched Mother's Mercy.Stannis' armies are broken outside the walls of Winterfell in an off-screen battle that looks far less one-sided than the relative strengths of the armies had us predict. The moment with Brienne had a weird sense of poetic justice, perhaps, but they ended up showing the sword strike off-screen as well, so Stannis' fate is still unresolved. Whether they killed him or not, the showrunners have managed to paint him as a monster in the previous episode that there is no great emotional value to his death. At least his possible last words were asking Brienne to do her duty. So the last surviving king from the War of the Five Kings is... Balon Greyjoy? I hope that the Battle outside Winterfell is far more fulfilling to read about than to watch.Even leaked earlier, Selyse's fate came as a surprise, and Melisandre abandoning Stannis appeared completely out of character. Did she not believe in R'hllor's power any more? Inside Winterfell, Sansa manages to pick her lock, leave her room, climb the broken tower and light her candle. Just after Brienne stopped looking, though. And of all the times for Reek to return to being Theon again, he chooses the moment where it's most convenient for the plot. And cliffhanger #2, what happened after the jump?I rather liked the way Arya killed Meryn, it reminded me of "Is there gold in the village?" from the books. But what the heck happened at the House of Black and White? Do they not know how the Faceless Men change their faces? And I thought Jaqen is No One, not Everyone! In any case, there's your cliffhanger #3, did they really blind Arya for disobedience? How did they manage to blind her, though - I didn't see her drink anything. I am glad to see the last of the Bronn-Tyene sparring, and I hope they don't make a spinoff sitcom starring those two. Of all the developments that happened in Dorne, the only one I liked was the conversation between Jaime and Myrcella this episode. That moment barely lasted half a minute, though. So cliffhanger #4 - will Jaime turn the ship back, and is Myrcella going to survive. Remembering the maegi's prophecy, it seems quite unlikely.Apparently nothing happened in the fighting pits of Meereen, as everyone abandoned by Dany appear unscathed. Even more surprising is the arrival of Varys, who was expected to be wreaking havoc in King's Landing at around this time. I have a feeling that Tyrion might be left behind at Meereen as Dany attempts to conquer Westeros. Assuming that's how her story plays out - for we have cliffhanger #5 - Dany being surrounded by the Dothraki which is very nearly the last sentence in Dany's story from the books. The ring she drops was something extra.Now for the title arc - Cersei at King's Landing. This is probably the best moment in this episode, as it invoked the same feelings as when I read that chapter in the books. It doesn't matter how much you hated her actions, you end up feeling sorry for Cersei after her horrendous treatment at the hands of the fanatics. There is an interesting deviation from the books, because Cersei is the only one to take the Walk of Penance, and we realize that it would have been different had she been a man. That casual misogyny of a patriarchal Westeros has been surprisingly sidestepped by the showrunners this time, as the High Septon was treated to a similar fate many episodes ago. I wonder what happens to Loras and Margaery next. Oh and, welcome back Robert Strong.And finally, the biggest moment in the series - I'll start with the positives. I was so glad to see that they just didn't have Olly stab Jon in the back when he was distracted and be done with it. His being the final death blow in a Caesar-ish assassination was executed well. The thing about Benjen was a nice touch, and the lack of information there was as much a disappointment for the fans as it was for Jon. In fact, I would have preferred that there was some wildling who saw Benjen, and then Jon takes some action that goes against his vows ending up in his own brothers butchering him in cold blood.Because that's where my biggest gripe in this episode lies (as far as Jon is concerned). In the book version, Ramsay sends a letter to Jon with demands, and Jon set out to answer it with force  with the help of the Free Folk - in essence breaking his vows yet again. The Night's Watch doesn't take part in the affairs of the realm, and Jon is about to march the wildlings to take on the Lord of Winterfell. It might look like a nitpick, but this changes everything - Jon is now killed just for bringing the wildlings in. And it's even made worse with Alliser leading the charge. It doesn't matter that he was followed by Yarwyck and Marsh and whoever it was - their "For the Watch" rings so hollow because we know that Alliser has been itching to stab Jon in the stomach for a long long time.The book attempt on Jon was a lot of an unresolved cliffhanger than the show version, because for all intents and purposes Jon appears to be have died. Well, except the fact that they sent Melisandre back to the Wall just in time to whip up some R'hllor magic. I remember a recent interview where Dan Weiss all but confirmed that Jon will be warging into Ghost, so I was surprised we never got to see that quiet wolf baring his fangs at all the treachery. I almost forgot, Sam was last seen driving Gilly and her son in a cart down to Oldtown. The intentions have been switched around, but it didn't really matter.Overall, it's not my least favourite finale episode from the series, and it was much better than some of the other episodes this season, but it just felt like a lot of squandered potential this year. Three stars mostly for Cersei.
s05e10	★★★★★A really good episode as it manages to salvage the season. Like the 10th episode of the previous season,this episode was filled with a lot of deaths. Is 10 becoming the new 9 for game of thrones?The sacrifice from last episode pays dividends as fire and agony from last episode are replaced with melting snow. All falls apart for Stannis after the sacrifice,as half of his army deserts him and his wife commits suicide. Mellisandre deserts him as she sees the end coming. It is somehow disappointing to see a proven military commander fall to the Boltons. He did lose at Blackwater but that was against the combined might of Tyrion Lannister and Tywin Lannister. Brienne finally has a chance to keep her honour as she finds Stannis at her sword's end.I refuse to believe that Stannis is dead. He will probably be nursed back to health by Brienne, as they wait for Ser Davos to arrive at Winterfell with an army of wildlings. As the battle ranges on Sansa is confronted by Myranda. We see glimpses of the old Theon as he tries helping his Sansa. It remains to be seen how the tv series tries to emulate this part of Theon's escape from Ramsay Bolton without the washerman and Stannis.HBO seems to be hell bent on showing the torture of women and girls. Last week had burning small girls while this week had beating up small girls. The mountain would be proud. We bear witness to some eye gouging again as Arya strikes the first name off her to do list. This is the only significant action of the Arya arc which can bear any consequences to the main storyline. Nevertheless the story completely converges in to the book as she is rendered blind by the end of the episode. By doing so they have violated the chronology of the books as she is blind only at the end of the fourth book, yet events in the fifth book have taken place.We are at Dorne again as the Martells bid their farewells to Jaime Lannister. The scene on the boat is awkward, yet executed brilliantly by Jaime Lannister. We now understand that Prince Doran has cause to worry as Ellaria sand takes up brash actions which endanger the life of the heir to Dorne. This will bear many negative consequences if Kings landing can muster up an appropriate response. Their first action would definitely be to behead Trystane Martell and then take Dorne.Mereen has an unexpected bald visitor. Daario picks his team of able men to search for his beloved queen. Tyrion is left out because he is a dwarf and he cannot fight..lame. Dany is trying to tame her dragon as she suddenly realises that she ditched them during last weeks episode. Kings Landing is embroiled in a civil war and is at its weakest. Cersei has her walk of shame. It remains to be seen if she learns anything from her wild adventures or if she simply wages war against the Faith and the Tyrells.Jon Snow got what he deserved.  I always expected the kid to kill him. He downfall was imminent after making one terrible decision after another. I do not believe that he will resurrected as many fans think or rather I do not want him to be resurrected. He was just like Ned Stark too naive and too noble and like all other men on the television show he dies.
s05e10	★tl;dr: This was the worst finale to probably the most slow-paced and fucked up season of the Game of thrones.*Spoilers Alert, if you're yet to see the episode*Like another review says, the episode seems so slow that you are tempted to watch it at 1.5x or 2x. There were a lot of moments where I needed to check how much of show was still left, and that's never a good sign. For the most part, I couldn't believe that this was a season finale given how dull and desultory the screenplay seemed.To be honest, Stannis' death and Arya killing Meryn Trant did bring some pleasure, but on the whole the episode seemed to jump from one act to another, especially towards the end of the episode. I don't know if it was just me that felt that Jon's death seemed a bit forced and lacking any real depth. It just felt like those last 4 minutes were made to add shock value to an episode featuring an otherwise insipid screenplay.Overall, I expected a lot from this season and was hoping that GoT would actually be one of the rare few which kept getting better and better with each passing season, but as the numbers show this season left many viewers disappointed. I can only hope that the next season would not be such a disaster. In fact, I'm not really sure that I even wanna watch it. It's like House of Cards all over again. (sigh)
s05e10	★★★★I was trembling with excitement and an equal amount of fear before this episode. Since I've already read the spoilers, I knew Jon Snow got this coming. Nevertheless, it was one of the best and shocking episodes of this season.Stannis.                 First they assassinated his character and now his body(?). Not sure about his death. But as an ardent fan of GOT, I don't expect him to come back. Since Brienne is as honorable as Ned (or better than him?), we can assume Stannis is dead as a doornail. I think he (Stannis) knew he was gonna lose when he burned his daughter alive (Life's a circle.) His look when Melisandre talks to him, tell us all. Damn, I loved him, a mistake every fan make.Myrcella.                      What a lovely scene that was! No, not the blood bursting one. The one in which she acknowledges Jaimie as her father. Emotions started outpouring and suddenly the poison shows its power. That was so cruel. Showing Jaimie a glimpse of fatherhood and takes it away in seconds? Stupid bitch, Ellaria Sand.Dany and co.                      Screw dany. She will be okay. But Tyrion, Missandei and Grey Worm administering the city? Yes, Tyrion is an accomplished administrator but it's Meereen. Not the Kings Landing where he could throw gold coins whenever he wants. Thank GRRM or David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, somehow Varys manages to come and help Tyrion. It will be interesting.Arya.                        My dear Arya Stark. Cute as always and cruel too. Yeah, that pedophile fucker deserved that. But she wasn't supposed to kill him. First a lie and now a murder? A girl shouldn't have done these things. Result, she can't see anymore. Very strict Braavosi people.Theon and Sansa.                         That was one good scene. Killing the lover of Ramsay and running away with his wife? Too much for Reek, but not for Theon. He deserves a revenge. Hope he gets one.Jon Snow.                           You know nothing. It's always your own people. Didn't you know about Mormont's death? And where the fuck was that fucking Ghost? Don't wanna say much. Just come back, okay? We all will be waiting for you. Forgive that fucker, olly. He was just a little boy and acted impulsively. I know you will forgive him. After all, you're Ned's nephew. Looking forward to the next season.
s05e10	★★★★★Spoilers Ahead!Another great episode however I'd rate it below Hardhome.1. I felt for Stannis I really did. He was my favorite character and he had such a bad end. I think this was the biggest let down of this season. Stannis was such an awesome and complicated character and the TV series really didn't do justice to him. However they gave him a good death at least or not?  2. Arya story has been pretty boring since the start however the kill was bad-ass. Finally some excitement in Arya's story because faceless men are literally faceless.3. Sand snakes finally did their intended. It will interesting to see how it plays out since Trystane Martell (Doran's son) is in Jaime's custody now. Why didn't sad snakes thought of that?4. Jon Snow. I'm pretty sure he'll come back however if he dies then White Walkers (Game of Thrones creature) Valar Morghulis (expression). (Kill them all!)
s05e10	★★★★The Season finale was not anything very interesting, but was far from boring like the previous episode. I might have given it a 3 star had it been in any of the previous seasons. The finale had nothing unexpected (at least for book-readers). But after the debacle, that's the ninth episode, this was a welcome change.Show starts with Stannis preparing to siege Winterfell. The Red Priestess observes the weather getting better, thereby inferring R'hllor has accepted the sacrifice. But Stannis is welcomed by the news of the sellswords deserting him, followed by the news of his wife taking her own life. With the odds stacked against Stannis, Melissandre, who by now realizes that Stannis is not Azor Ahai, leaves the camp to move to Castle Black (She must have realized Jon is Azor Ahai). Boltons make little work of the weary troops of Stannis, who by now would have lost any confidence in the endeavor, with a pre-emptive strike. But I was surprised that Ramsay himself didn't make sure Stannis was put to the sword. An injured Stannis encounter Brienne, who abandons her post from where the beacon at Winterfell is visible, who appears to keep her vow by killing Stannis. But as the body is not shown the situation is ambiguous as what happened.    Meanwhile at Winterfell, Theon saves Sansa from Myranda and helps her escape by killing Myranda. It was not expected of Reek to find the Theon inside him, but that little bit he found inside him was enough to help Sansa. It's shown that both Sansa and Theon jumping from the walls of Winterfell. We can safely assume they are jumping onto the snow. But with Castle Black quite far and them not having any horses, they ideally would not survive the harsh weather conditions. Couple that with the scouting parties Ramsay will deploy once he finds out his "Queen" is missing, we can assume Theon's life might not be spared this time.At Braavos now. It's not quite surprising to find Arya cut a name of her list by exacting revenge on Meryn Trant. It was a brutal way to kill him, but at some level he might have deserved it. She has started to show the assassin in her by the way she got inside Trant's room. But The Many-faced god has his rules and now Arya has to pay the price for carrying out a death which was not a contract. She loses her eyesight as the punishment. This is the only part of the show that is lagging the books as in the books she has regained her sight. But after 9 episodes of absolute nothing at Braavos this was far from unexpected.The way Dorne is portrayed in the show is ludicrous. Myrcella is shown to be murdered in a way fitting for the Sand Snakes, by posion. But by that the whole point of including Jaime's journey to Dorne has become a pointless unwanted addition to the show. The Sand Snakes could have very well done that before Jaime's arrival. Now that whole Jaime-Bronn journey to Dorne is rendered useless. Ellaria would ideally take the entire blame for this operation and most likely will face a lifetime inside the cells in Dorne, letting Sand Snakes off the hook. But this move has weakened Dorne's position as Trystane will now be a hostage in King's Landing. Had Sand Snakes carried out the assassination in Dorne itself, Trystane would have been safe. Once Cersei comes to know about Myrcella, Trystane will fall prey to Ser Robert Strong's blade (wait, we haven't reached Robert Strong yet, eh). Dorne can now ready themselves for the inevitable war, though there is hardly any way Dorne is going to lose this one.In Mereen, Tyrion is made the governor to rule mereen in Dany's stead as Jorah and Daario start their exploration to find the missing queen. How any of them got out of the ambush is still unknown, may be Unsullied would have reached the pits after Dany decided to take flying lessons abandoning her subjects. Varys is shown to have reached Mereen and inside the castle. How he reached inside the castle without alerting Tyrion is quite strange. Meanwhile Dany is trying to fly Drogon again, looks like flying lessons didn't go well as Drogon seems least interested (Dany is least bothered by the countless spears that went through the poor flying machine). Dany is surrounded by the Dothraki horde when she goes searching for food. What happens next is ambiguous and we can only find out in the next season. In King's Landing, Cersei has pleaded guilty to her adultery involving Lancel and seeks atonement. Since she pleads not guilty for the charges of incest she has to stand a trial. But meanwhile she has to do the "Walk of Shame" as atonement for her sins. By the way crowd reacts, it's quite evident that Cersei has lost the appeal in the capitol and Tommen has been far from from impressive as a ruler. Qyburn has rejuvenated Mountain, but in his form, as Ser Robert Strong. May be he will fight for Cersei in her trial by combat for the other charges of sin. I wonder who will the Faith stage as their Champion??!!To the Wall. Earlier in the episode we are seeing Sam heading to Citadel along with Gilly, making Jon lose his only ally at the Castle Black. In the closing scenes we are shown Olly luring Jon to a secluded area of Castle Black with the mention of Benjen Stark. There a section of Night's Watch awaits for Jon to betray him for his decision to bring Wildlings to the Black. Jon is stabbed repeated by them while murmuring "For The Black". What might await the Black will mostly be a civil war. Will Wildlings exact revenge for Jon is to be seen.This episode was mainly tying up the loose ends of this season. I have to credit them for the way this was shot, with hardly any scene seeming to bore us. Jon in all likelihood is dead, but I won't put my bets on him staying dead. What impressed me was that Stannis, even at the face of death, upholds duty, asking Brienne to do her duty by executing him.What next for Davos is to be seen. When you look back, you find that the story has progressed very little in this season. I am hoping Winds of Winter would be released next year, with very little expectation from D&D.
s05e10	★★★★Damn, I thought this was another great episode! Across-the-board super-interesting story arc climaxes:Jon Snow: wow I didn't see that coming, but it totally makes senseCersei's walk: amazing, intenseStannis ending: loved itMyrcella Baratheon/Lannister: brutalTheon and Sansa: great - we needed thatArya: super-dramaticEh, the stuff with Daenerys and her merry men was OK, but not great; but that was a transitional set up to next season.If you haven't read the books, this was yet another great, super-entertaining episode. I think the book readers have a standard that may be too high.
s05e10	I typically recap all Game of Thrones' episodes, and I loved analyzing "Mother's Mercy."  You can read my thorough (and humorous) review here, as it was featured on my blog See, Here's the Thing.  A few areas of focus included:MeereenDorneStannis' CampSansa's Escape 
s06e04	Going down off the top of my head:Thank God they actually reunited Jon and Sansa and didn’t pull the “oh you just missed him” shit I thought they might. Why they had Jon march toward the northern side of the Wall only to … stay where he was … I don’t know. But the Jon/Sansa reunion was great and I’m glad Sansa is having him get his ass in the game. The major plot I actually cared about — Jon, Sansa and getting the North back — is finally primed. And so many great characters are intersecting here, it’s wonderful. I’m guessing Brienne and Podrick head to the Riverlands to try to get the Tullys on board (or at least, see what’s happening), while Davos and Sansa and Co. go on their big PR tour. I’d like to see Jon get more gung ho (see his reaction to the Pink Letter in the book), but baby steps. It also makes me wonder if this will also be the core group that eventually “fights the good fight” against not only Ramsay but also the Others and *gulp* maybe Dany. Jon, Davos, Brienne, Tormund, Sansa and even Melisandre on the same side looks a LOT like, “Here is your final pack of protagonists.” Is it any coincidence that all of these characters are suddenly now converged (and have converging goals even if, say, Brienne and Pod go to the Riverlands) as the show enters its endgame? I don’t think so.The Faith stuff is officially a slog. We get it, Cersei is pissed, Tommen is dickless, Loras and Margaery are trapped and the Sparrow is nuts. Get on with it.Not a fan of the Iron Islands in the book, even though I like Asha (Yara). Interesting to throw Theon into the Kingsmoot, though.I still do not give a shit about Meereen but it was interesting to see Tyrion make what looked like progress where Dany couldn’t make any. I think we’re meant to wonder if Tyrion is right and compromise was necessary, or Missandei and Grey Worm are right and Tyrion’s being naive. Could be either one. But I don’t care which. :-(You knew Osha wasn’t long for the world but I’d have liked to see her go out better than that. I guess we should be thankful it wasn’t another hounds-devour-woman scene or a rape scene or anything too horrific. Stabbed in the throat is probably the best way she could have gone out. It also drove the point home that Ramsay is not Theon and can’t be flattered or persuaded.I have finally found my zen with the Dany-is-fireproof bullshit. I can’t tell if I wasn’t giving them enough credit before or am giving them too much credit now, but here you go: Kelsey L. Hayes's answer to Why is Daenerys Targaryen apparently immune to fire in the show “Game of Thrones”? And thinking about it more, the red priests might enter the picture as a direct result of hearing about her newest stunt. Which would actually just further drive home my point.I actually found the Dothraki set-up itself much more annoying than Dany being fireproof, something the show had already sort of established. These other women just need a Girl Talk, doncha know, to get out of their rut. And the Dothraki are sexist rapist assholes who underestimate the girl, like any foe Dany seems to face, really, so it’s cool if they just sit there and do absolutely nothing while she knocks over some braziers. And of course all the cowed brown people immediately kneel the fuck down before the naked pasty girl coming out of the fire. I groaned; they didn’t learn their lesson from the “yay colonialism!” shit that ended the third season. I mentioned this in another answer, but this, THIS, is your bright line between Jon and Dany: Jon experiences a touch of the magical and immediately says he isn’t a god and is freaked by the whole thing and doesn’t expect, demand or welcome adoration or worship from anyone. Whereas Dany looks on like, “Hell yeah, bow before me, serfs” (note the use of Smug Smirkface, one of Dany’s three trademark expressions, along with Vacant Mile-Long Stare and Crazyface). I know everyone is ~caught up in the moment~ but … something is not right here. And I think D&D may be telling us as much and it’s getting lost in the “omg Dany is amazing!” thing on the one hand from show-only viewers and “What the hell are they doing?” reaction from the book-readers. Both sides see Dany as this special heroic snowflake (either because they actually think she is or because they’re annoyed D&D are painting her as such) but I’m not sure that’s what’s being conveyed.The good news is that the quota’d Dany power moment for the season is done with. Let’s move on.
s06e04	It was pretty bad. While it isn’t as bad as some of the top stinkers (S5E10, S6E1), there was too much that’s disappointing at best or just plain stupid at worst.Let’s start with what’s plain stupid.-The ending scene with Daenerys, the darling D&D are trying too hard to make us love. Why did the Khals do nothing but stand around scared when she spills over the brazier? I thought these men built their lives around being able to react to intense situations. Also, as many lore buffs on Quora emphasize, Dany isn’t supposed to be immune to fire. That’s a fact that GRRM himself confirmed. Of course, at this point, it’s clear that the minds behind the show don’t give a damn about the source material. Even worse, they care more about presenting this dumbed down, generic good vs. evil story for the masses, which just isn’t what ASOIAF is about.Now let’s move on to what’s disappointing.I was expecting Euron to appear again this episode, the Kingsmoot to happen, and for another good taste of his seductive eccentric insanity but all we got was this scene that consisted of Yar(Asha) being mad with Theon about the events of her failed rescue back in Season 4.The failed rescue that to this day, is close to being one of the worst scenes to come out of Game of Thrones, featuring shirtless Ramsay and vengeful Ironborn who don’t even try to hit him. Seriously, there was this great opening for Yara to throw an axe at him while he was busy opening the dog cages, but they needed Ramsay to survive for at least two more seasons (so he could rape Sansa, display ungodly military prowess against Stannis, kill his father without any real consequences, feed Walda and his little brother without any real consequences and get rewarded by a free young Stark boy immediately after, thwart an assassination attempt and knife Tonks in the neck, etc.). It’s clear they want him to be the Big Bad against Sansa and Jon, at the “big” (~5000 Boltons, less wildlings, ??Vale Army) that’ll last all of S6E9.(As far as that battle goes…it’s something that doesn’t sound very exciting. In terms of scale, it’s just a battle between leftovers from the War of the Five Kings. It should have happened last season. The Battle of the Blackwater was ten times more massive, and the events at Hardhome was ten times more significant as far as plot goes. Instead, they have Brienne execute Stannis to give a battle that should have been his victory to Jon, and have it fill up an entire episode at the end of the subsequent season. I thought we’d be having the Others break down the wall by this point, but it looks like they’re competing with Daenerys in some procrastinate-on-getting-to-the-seven-kingdoms-competition.)At the wall, Brienne reveals to Davos that she executed Stannis. He should have put a knife through her eyes right there for that, but sadly, he didn’t. Hopefully Brienne becomes fuel for another Melisandre sacrifice, or gets the Reek treatment from Ramsay. But this isn’t a just world, and that’s not going to happen, because she’s apparently going to be in Riverrun later this season. Why would she? To get assistance from the Tullys? Edmure is a prisoner, and the Blackfish is under siege by Lannisters (who she’s worked with) at Riverrun. How can they help? One thing is clear, she’ll be back to filling her role as the most useless character on the screen.(Note: My dislike of Brienne isn’t because of her character traits, but because she’s another Olly, and to some extent, another Ramsay. She performs feats the writers need to be performed to advance the plot. Olly was shoehorned into shanking Jon. Ramsay was shoehorned into being invincible so that he can torture and rape to his hearts delight (so that we can hate him and cheer for Jon/Sansa to bring about his downfall…which will probably be done by Littlefinger instead - HA!! ha……………………ohgod)The character that everyone was clamoring to resurrect, Jon Snow, isn’t back with a vengeance. You would think that he would be jumping out of death itself to give the mutineers a taste of Longclaw, and display the kind of badass ruthlessness worthy of the Starks who held the North for millenia. He’s supposed to be back to be the real Prince Who Was Promised. He is the real Warrior of Light (not that Stannis poser; who, by the way, had a much more compelling actor). The next target on his list should be the bastard who raped his half-sister repeatedly and holds a North that won’t be united against the pending White Walker invasion.But…he’s back with this weird intent to just…give up? What was he planning on doing before receiving the Pink Letter? Dress like Ned Stark and wait for Ramsay to come in and mistake him for a character played by Sean Bean? Pathetic.At this point, I wouldn’t be surprised if he accidentally trips and falls on Ramsays sword with that stupid vacant expression Kit Harington loves to perpetually give. Sadly, the audience would still clamor for another resurrection.
s06e04	Prologue: I think a lot of the disappointment for book readers is that the show just has ‘magic’. ‘Magic’ is generic and just does stuff: Dragon hatching is magic, Melisandre is magic and does magic. Magic happens.To be honest, in my eyes, that’s a good thing. If we saw the subtleties, the real ‘cost’ of the different types of magic in the books, it would be a massive spoiler. We’d be able to extrapolate ‘rules’ and ‘origins’ and ‘mechanisms’ and it would ruin books 6 and 7. If this is the rationale, then colour me grateful: I appreciate the thought.Castle Black: Early adopters of Sansa the strong woman were absolutely right. She is fab. The best aspect of show Sansa is that she doesn’t follow the Dany-Melisandre rule for reasoned debate…’when they doubt, let them out’. Keeping her top on at all times, she is intelligent and fearless. Meanwhile Tormund is giving Brienne the full Joey Tribbiani - ‘how you doing?’The Vale: Like Rickon, Robert has grown up real fast: toddler to teen in 30 seconds. Littlefinger buys his ‘yeah…whatever….Moon Door’ with a falcon. A Gyr-falcon. It absolutely beggars belief that the Lord of the fucking Vale, the spoilt little bastard with falcons on practically everything in his impregnable castle, which is called the fucking Eyrie, has never owned a falcon before. The Knights of the Vale must be supremely stupid never to have thought of buying him a falcon because, if I were prepared to do Lysa Arryn to gain power, I’d have explored every single other option first. Seems obvious to me, but maybe I’m an absolute genius like Littlefinger. Though not as creepy. Looking forward to seeing his head decorating a spike in Winterfell.King’s Landing: the Lord Privy Toast-Rack Tommen is blithering. Boring.Meereen: If anyone needs to get their boobs out it’s Tyrion because Grey Worm and Missendei are struggling to believe in the Audacity of Hope. Tyrion is still doing his House MD impression: should he be called on for an urgent diagnosis, it’s either the AWOIAF equivalent of sarcoidosis, or the AWOIAF equivalent of Wegner’s. It’s always one or the other. Never lupus, though (thanks, Govind).Vaes Dothrak: The Dothraki are cargo-culted by the new House Targaryen words: ‘Boobs and Fire.’ Magic everywhere.There’s a hell of a mess to clear up.If we’re being picky, it does seem strange that the Dothraki are awed by the impressive Unburnt conclusion to Dany’s Disco Inferno. They ride all over Essos, doing their pillaging and stuff, and that continent is chock full of weirdos. Blue lipped weirdos. Shadow-binding weirdos. Warlock weirdos. It’s not like they don’t get out much. I very much suspect that they’re following her for her boobs. Why not?EDIT: it’s easy to be wise after the event, but Royce should have offered Robert TWO falcons, then two falcons and a SPARROWHAWK, then two falcons, a sparrowhawk and sixteen PARROTS…keep raising Royce, at some point Littlefinger’s going to run out of caged birds because his wheelhouse isn’t so big. Then, we’ll see who’s the better man…
s06e04	Despite the spectacle that that had been missing in the last three episodes, I was disappointed in this one. Probably my least favorite of the entire season.I think it’s just all too predictable, which would be OK if I thought the dialogue and the acting was really blowing me away. The acting is adequate but the dialogue is just horrible. Again, the High Septon’s monologue is just another example of how bad Benioff and Weiss’ dialogue is to me. I can’t put my finger on it: it’s almost a good monologue but because it just misses being good by a hair’s-breadth it comes off as predictable, dull, cliched and shallow to me. Like, they say: we need to fill time, let’s make a two person dialogue scene; we’ll give some backstory of the High Septon! And then they proceed to nail all their well-worn cliches into it. Just awful. I still feel like they stress their political agendas even when they try not to. It’s annoying.Sort of like Jon Bonjovi’s lyrics. That’s the nearest analogy that I can make. Which is weird but there you go.The plot is moving forward on all fronts, but overall the episode disappointed me and didn’t satisfy me. As always, I pin the blame on Weiss and Benioff’s writing most of all.AS far as the last scene goes, I was thinking yesterday that Dany would pull her big move in this episode four, after the last three episodes that were without huge spectacle.. However, I thought that Drogon would rescue her.I think it is a better choice that Dany does it herself. So Dany herself, it seems, is the Stallion Who Mounts the World, at least in the show. That’s pretty cool. I’m still not sold that it’s her and not Drogon in the books.I had a bit of a problme with the execution of the scene. Something about the music and Emilia Clarke’s glassy gaze made me literally laugh out loud. It just felt off, the camera angles were funny and cliched. I did get a sense that it was going for a bit of a horror film feel, oddly, which makes me think that they are setting up Dany to commit atrocities.But broadly it was all very predictable.I was glad to see that Jon, realizing that his winter apparel was not going to cut it, came back to do some last minute packing.The reunion scene between Sansa and Jon was really well done and it brought tears to my eyes: I had’dt realized how much I wanted Starks together.Exactly as I predicted, Jon said no, Sansa said yes, news of Rickon came and Jon said yes. the D’s are not as clever as GRRM. The show is much more predictable than the books.The scene of everybody eating with their hands and grunting amused me.I’m shipping Brienne and Tormund Rib-chewer. Davos is going to kill the Melisandre.I’m surprised that they had Saint Tyrion the Goldenhearted, he of the Mellifluous, Badly-accented Voice allow slavery to continue. The show thus far as been very clear about it’s SLAVERY IS BAD message. So, here is what is going to happen: Those whores that Tyrion sat on the slaver’s laps? They are going to kill the slavers. Trust me. THERE WILL BE WAR.Oh, man. I’m not surprised that she bit the big one(and how cliched was that?) but I hoped that Natalie Tena would have more scenes than that. She crackles on-screen like few of the actors in that series do. Bummer.Vaes Dothrak, well, my thoughts on the final scene are above. I found the Daario/Mormont scenes a bit lacklustre and ho-hum. However, not as much as other scenes this season.Jaime and especially Cersei actors had a bit more meat on the bone of their script to chew on, but it all seems so rushed and dull, still. I do assume that they will attack the Sept but I’m not sure if that will play out well for Margaery and Loras who again is annoying in his wussiness as compared to the cocky but tough book Loras.
s06e04	My review is out of order and to entertain all of you, I cried at the beginning of the episode and then was screaming by the end of it. I tried not to put some spoilers-Sansa and Jon reuniting, Thanks to D & D, At least they united 2 Starks. Sansa showing character growth, apologizing to Jon, hanging out at the night's watch, and finally taking control of her own story with the push to march on Winterfell.High Sparrow backstory was good, I always like his bold and calm attitude. Ser Loras made a small appearance, sorry from him from all the book fans, And for all TV series fans- I tell you he is not just a gay man, he is a fighter, and that too a great one.My favorite scene was of Theon and Asha, But I feel like something weird is going to happen, like he's going to lay down his life for her. I feel like there has go be some "greater purpose" for him.Osha was playing the same game like always but Ramsay is not Theon.Things are going way too well for Littlefinger. But I don't think his campaign for Winterfell will be successful, since he's marching north with southern soldiers during winter (and also Sansa probably wants his head on a platter)Poor Jorah tried the pocket sand technique in a fight but it didnt go well. Thanks to Daario for saving one of my favorite characterI am not liking any Tyrion scenes, I know he will get a Emmy but still their is something off about them. And Missandai in them business pants, Who is designing clothes for her.What stole the show was …Ohhh Dany…."To go forward, you must go back." Dany's story circled back to the end of the first season. Dany. She is special, she is the mother of dragons and immune to fire. Not book Dany, but show Dany is. So please stop worrying book fans.Tormund eating seductively was without a doubt the highlight of the episode. Tormund doesn't break eye contact. Brienne might finally get broken in, He is the Giant’s bane after all.and we are coming for you, Bastard
s06e04	★★☆☆☆I was going to give this episode 4 stars out of 5, because for the most part, I liked how things were happening - until the very end, a scene which was like someone pissing in a fairly decent bowl of soup.Spoilers if you haven’t watched The Book of the Stranger yet.My favourite parts of the episode, as one could easily guess, were the events happening at Castle Black. It was refreshing to see two Starks together after such a long time, and their acknowledgement of their past was touching. Tormund appears to be seriously interested in Brienne, though she looked positively creeped out. I wanted to see how far Davos would go in confronting Melisandre, but Brienne interrupted before we could find out. It’s sad to see that Sansa has to try so hard to convince Jon to reclaim Winterfell, especially after they got Ramsay’s letter about Rickon. Maybe Jon did lose something at the resurrection. Speaking of Ramsay, while it was disappointing that we won’t be seeing Osha again, I must admit that I was glad to see her go quickly.King’s Landing was, well, let’s say promising some action in the upcoming episodes. The Lannister-Tyrell alliance is appearing to be strengthened, mostly thanks to Cersei. When the High Sparrow started with his backstory about his cobbling days, I was really expecting a monologue that Septon Meribald would be proud of. But it was, at best, laughable - I thought he had seen what has war has done to the people, and that he would say something like what Mirri Maz Duur said to Dany - “you will burn down no more septs, your knights will not trample any more children into the dust” - but no, he found religion after he got hungover and saw a lot of naked dudes. Laughable. There was one more sibling reunion - between Margaery and Loras - and the former’s resolve is commendable. I was getting a lot of Reek vibes from Loras, however, in more ways than one.Things are brewing elsewhere in the Seven Kingdoms, with quick looks at the Vale and the Iron Islands. The show has finally revealed Littlefinger’s true intentions, as he easily convinces young Robert Arryn to committing the Knights of the Vale against the Boltons. I’m not sure if it would have been better or worse to leave it as a surprise, but based on the promo for the next episode, the real surprise is how Littlefinger is capable of travelling so fast! The third and final sibling reunion in this episode was at Pyke, where Theon appears almost magically, with no explanation given as to how he managed to get to the shore and hire a ship. We will have to wait and see what he is going to do next episode, which is going to be the Kingsmoot.Meereen was mostly mediocre, with Tyrion offering terms to Yunkai and Astapor, to the chagrin of the freed people of Meereen. I have a feeling that he is stalling, trying to cut the funding of the Sons by any means necessary, while he waits for Daenerys to return. The promo shows him taking further steps, allying with anyone who would help keep some order in the city.And finally, the fiasco. Vaes Dothrak was definitely the most anticipated part of this episode, with Jorah and Daario arriving to rescue Daenerys out of the hands of hundreds of thousands of angry warriors. Dany is shown to be making friends among sympathetic dosh khaleen, one of them anyway, while her rescuers somehow manage to make contact with her. When Dany refused to go with them, I knew she had a plan, which was also made clear by the smug look on her face when she has addressing the small congregation of khals. Surprisingly, they are so patient with her, finding her atrocious comments adorable. Next thing we know, she burns down the whole temple, and walks out of it naked and unburnt, while all the khals are dead. How convenient. More than anything else, I wonder how did that place catch on fire so quickly - did they construct it in such a way that a tipped over brazier would just bring the whole place down? I mean, I would have understood if it was dragonfire, but a bowl of burning coals? So she’s immune to fire now. Sooner or later she is going to pull a Johnny Storm and go “Flame on”, I’m sure.While Margaery quotes a line from it, giving the reason for this episode title, the final scene reveals the true meaning - the showrunners don’t give a damn about the book of some stranger.3/10.
s06e04	I liked this episode. Going by the TV, and not on books, I loved this episode. Not thinking about deus ex machina part of the final scene,First things first in the first scene - the hug that made me so happy, Sansa and Jon reuniting. Everything was perfect in that scene. Sansa being truly happy in ages, Stark children meeting and reminiscing about old times, Sansa finding the fire in her belly (I’ll take back Winterfell, with or without your help). Queen in the making!!!The pink letter is also here. So the two things I was waiting for to stop Jon from leaving Castle Black happened in the same episode. Now we wait for the planning phase on how to attack Boltons and their supporting houses.Was Brienne trying to antagonize Davos and Melisandre or was she just gloating in their misery? I thought D&D would reveal the truth about Shireen to Davos through her but the scene took another turn. And there was some serious heart eyes from Tormund to Brienne. One off thing or something being planned for future? you decide.At the opposite end - The Queen that has staked her claim. And it was done through another one of her larger than life feat which brought the entire Dothraki to their knees. Dany burned all the Khals and came unburnt from the flames. Clear message that she is near God mode in TV show and I find the possibility of her turning into an antagonist (in the show) infinitesimal. While the gesture and scene was as good as they can be when it comes to other grand scenes of Dany in the show, it just amused me to see the years of “Dany is not immune to fire” going down the drain. Old weak poor Targaryens of the old who were killed by fire, Dany has no time for some weak-ass flames.The middle of the episode was not much to rave about but it started the wheel in motion for the coming episodes.LF has entered the frey and has secured his armies. I thought that he would descend upon the survivors of War of the Bastards, finish them off, and claim Wintefell for his own. But by the looks of promo of next episode, it seems that he is at Castle Black and may join Jon in a combined attack. Let Sansa slap him couple of times, please!! (did you knew about Ramsay?).Theon had a homecoming, not a happy one, with Yara fearing that he will make his claim for the throne. Theon was quick to alleviate her fears and the brother-sister had a tense reconciliation. The main villain should enter in the next episode.Meeren plot is having some parallels with last season story line at Wall. Tyrion wants to achieve lasting peace and understands that it will take a handshake to achieve that and not cutting the hand off, but slaves are having a hard time to understand his plan. Tyrion is also a fav of D&D so him sharing the fate of season 5 finale Jon is close to none, but will he get some kind of threat to his life? Anyway, this line of story will be moot as Dany is about to swoop in with her horde of Dothraki and quite possibly all three dragons to achieve peace in 7 min vs Tyrion’s 7 years. There is your difference between a God and a mortal, at least in the TV show.Osha’s fate was expected, she was well out of her depth when dealing with Ramsay, who also can do nothing wrong in the TV show.King’s Landing is ripe with the tension of the battle that is about to come (promo scenes of season 6 with Tyrell army at the steps of Sept). Cersei has convinced Olenna and Kevan. Tommen is easily persuaded with anyone who talks with him for 5 mins and is not of a concern. The question to be discussed and debated is will their plan to attack Sept meet some debacle? As the scene with Lancel asking Cersei to order Gregor to stand aside doesn’t align with Cersei’s current scheme of attaching and successfully getting rid of High Sparrow.On a final note - Margaery showed her strength and wits by quickly understanding the plan of High Sparrow, but sadly Loras is broken. Even if he is rescued now, he may be of no use to anyone for a long time to come. This may be a parallel to the books, where he is of no use to anyone because of the injuries he received while storming Dragonstone.On an ending note, Please sir, May I have some more of Sansa and Jon avenging the Starks together for the rest of the season.
s06e04	This was the best episode of the season. [Spoilers ahead]Is Raksha Bandhan around the corner?An unnaturally high number of siblings reunite this episode.Sansa reaches the Wall before Jon can escape, and presumably postpones his retirement plans. Ramsay’s deliciously villainous letter has the unintended result of getting Tormund riled up and he now faces a difficult battle against the free folk led by a free Jon.Margaery gets to see what’s left of Loras and tries her best to mollify him. Loras seems to be beyond hope however, and if a confession is truly what the High Sparrow is after, it ought to be apparent that he is a much easier nut to crack than Margaery.The scene between Theon and Yara told us nothing we didn’t already know — Theon is broken, has no interest in the throne, and will back his sister in the Kingsmoot.Not so little fingerAt the Vale, Baelish finally made an appearance. His act of gifting a falcon to his step-son Robin seemed ingenuous enough at first but was in fact an overt case of jury tampering. Having won the childish Robin’s favor, Baelish uses it to threaten his guardian lord into submission and then to recruit him to his cause of marching on the North. Helping extinguish the Bolton family line is another pernicious masterstroke by Littlefinger, as it would redeem him not just in the eyes of Sansa but also the rulers down South.Given how far Baelish has come playing one piece off another, only something supernatural would prevent him from eventually sitting on the Iron Throne. And when that day should come, the Game of Thrones would lose its finest player.RealpolitikTyrion is putting to use the political chops he picked up in King’s Landing, by cutting deals with the slave-masters in an attempt to buy peace. While Missandei and Greyworm’s concerns are easy for him to dismiss, selling this scheme to Daenerys might be another beast altogether.Over in King’s Landing, the ruling class put aside their differences for now in order to get rid of the populist uprising that could uproot their world order. For more on this, see my answer to Does Cersei's plan to deal with the Faith Militant have ulterior motives? If so, what are they?Daenerys takes a leaf out of Hanuman’s bookBrought to Vaes Dothrak against her wishes and browbeaten by the sexist Khals and hardened Dosh Khaleen alike, Daenerys decides to finally give the rapists their comeuppance in a certified badass Khaleesi scene. I admit, when Dany started making her speech, I feared for her life and wondered how she planned to wriggle her way out of this conundrum. But unlike her clueless commanders, she actually had a plan; a plan to, in the words of her mad father, “burn them all”.In what is a stunning throwback to the season one finale, the episode ends with a majestic shot of the Dothraki bowing to Dany, who has once again come out of a fire unburnt and (to the collective cheer of prurient teenagers around the world) naked.Closing thoughtsWith only 19 episodes left in the show, creaters Benioff & Weiss have reached unprecedented levels of ruthlessness, killing off one secondary character after the other. I personally love this as all three murders so far (Doran, Roose and now Osha) have been bonafide shock moments.The limited time left has also ensured that a number of primary storylines have begun intersecting and slowly approaching their respective climaxes. It can’t be long now before we see all the big face-offs.Of course, while the petty humans settle their scores and grapple over territory, the biggest threat of them lurks out of sight, biding his time, waiting to strike.
s06e04	(Show Spoilers)This episode was designed to interest us. It anticipated that many fans would be wondering: Where is Littefinger? What is going on with Daenarys Targaryen? Will Meereen survive the Sons of the Harpy? What happened to poor Robin Arryn? When is Margaery going to figure out how to beat the High Sparrow at his own game?And all I wanted to do was stay with Sansa and Jon Snow.That is the best part of the episode. Sansa comes to the Night’s Watch before Jon Snow leaves. So his dark night of the soul has begun to abate. Brienne makes sure to tell Melissandre and Davos about the death of Stannis, so the show has finally wiped their hands of Stannis Baratheon. Melissandre commits herself to Jon Snow as she is sure he is the Prince that is Promised, while Davos reminds her that she thought the same of Stannis—that was good timing on his part. And Jon Snow finally gets the pink letter—come and see. His sense of purpose exists with a fervor. Rickon is a prisoner, and Ramsay decides to insult every Wilding while Tormund, not much of a reader, hears the letter aloud. So the Battle of the Bastards has been set in motion. The show seems to care about this story very much.But we have other stories. I suppose the show put a lot of money into making Dany look like the Terminator. Littlefinger is all but ruler in the Vale, and he plans to help Sansa, but we know it isn’t out of altruism. Cersei wants to stop the High Sparrow with the help of her uncle and a determined Olenna Tyrell. Jaime is still not doing much of anything, while his little brother is meeting with the slavers to make some accord about their economic rights while Grey Worm and Missandei fume. The Ironborn were gone before my eyes adjusted to the screen. Loras Tyrell has been broken by the Faith Militant—how? I want to know the purpose of that crazy storyline. Margaery may be the only live wire left in King’s Landing. Daario really likes one of his knives, we find out. Yeah.I found the episode to be dull, dull, dull. And no, I don’t need shock, death, boobs, butts, and cool CGI. I need a good story. I need characters to behave like they aren’t sleepwalking. The episode is burning through storylines without giving time for us to even connect the dots. This was very disappointing. Does the show only have one good storyline left—the Starks? What is happening to Game of Thrones?
s06e04	★★★★☆ - Why 4/5 : The last scene ” Dany isn’t supposed to be immune to fire. That’s a fact that GRRM himself confirmed. But its TV show and Who cares…Note: I’m reviewing “Game of Thrones” from the perspective of someone who has read all of George R.R. Martin’s novels.There are lots of reviews to I’m just summing up mine:Verdict:A part of what makes the theme of forgiveness so strong in “Book of the Stranger” is the way the episode delineates between the slights you should forgive because they’re truly past, the injuries you forgive for strategic reasons and the sins so grave that they make resolution truly impossible.All told, a really strong episode of Game of Thrones. I don’t have a lot of complaints. I loved the family reunion at Castle Black. I loved Dany finally getting her groove back and defeating her enemies. But, as mentioned earlier it doesn’t happened the way many os us expected. I hope it’s a sign of her taking charge and just beating the crap out of her enemies in Slaver’s Bay so she can move on to Westeros.Theon and Yara had such a brief scene, I didn’t feel like flying all the way to the Iron Islands to talk about it this week. Suffice to say, Yara needed to lay off a bit and show some sympathy. Theon’s been through a hell nobody could possibly understand. I was glad to see him lend her his support, and I’m eager to get on with that plot and see what happens with it. The Iron Islands have been much ignored in this show, and I’m curious where it all leads.I didn’t like how Davos began questioning Melisandre about Princess Shireen and then got sidetracked by Brienne’s entrance. That needs to be addressed, and soon. If nothing else, Davos will think better of Brienne when he learns what horrors Stannis finally stooped to (even if I will never forgive the showrunners for so badly mangling Stannis.) How Davos will react, and what he might try to do to Melisandre, remains to be seen. But he needs to know that a little girl was murdered for the red priestess’ quest.I was even less fond of Tyrion’s scenes, but maybe he’ll surprise me. and I quite believe he’ll. I also didn’t care for Ramsay and Osha’s scene. We don’t need to keep seeing Ramsay do bad things to remember he’s a villain. That’s firmly established. Killing a Wildling woman who we haven’t seen in two seasons with a knife is nowhere near as shocking or horrible as what he did to his father’s wife and his little half-brother anyways.And yes we are coming for you, Bastard… waiting for Bastard-bowl. Who else?Thanks for A2A Monu Kamble.
s06e04	It was the best episode of the season so far to me. Things are definitely unfolding like I thought they would so far.Biggest surprise for me was Brienne confirming that she killed Stannis and also issuing a not so idle threat to Melisandre, which may make for some interesting conflict.It was kind of a weird transition how Melisandre just went from manic to casually believing Jon is ‘the one’. I found it interesting she actually is now calling him ‘the prince that was promised’ instead of Azor Ahai.Sansa is finally having her Furiosa moment, which is great. I wonder how Littlefinger is going to weasel out of selling out Sansa when she confronts him?I was actually expecting Drogon to show up and confirm the Stallion that mounts the world prophecy at the burning house, but I guess it wasn’t in the budget. I’m probably in the minority, but I am actively rooting against Dany. I don’t like her character at all and I think the Targaryens are villains. Dragons are bad.I’m really not liking the Kings Landing story arc. I already figured Olenna was going to come in and get her grandchildren, but I don’t really like how they are making it seem like Cersei is the brains of the operation, when the entire Faith Militant problem is her fault to begin with. I have a feeling that Tommen is now on the death clock since Cersei’s trial is coming up.Meereen is still a mess. I feel they changed too much of the book version to actually make it interesting. Its at least good to see Tyrion back in a Hand role which hes best at. They could have at least fleshed out the slavery sidebar by going more indepth with Missandei and Greyworm’s relationship. I don’t like how they only use their characters in an oblivious capacity. They are really missing an opportunity to flesh out the heart of that conflict.I have a feeling that Rickon’s days may also be numbered. We all know Ramsay will get his due and be treated like a mad dog, but I think hes going to take Rickon with him. I still think a version of the Great Northern Conspiracy will happen. I think Ramsay may even be double-crossed and the Umbers will give him their own version of the Red Wedding.It looks like Bran has been relegated to being the flash back machine. Kind of a let down to have him go all that way to be used as a plot hole filling device.
s06e04	Some brilliant reviews here.Here's mine, and I won't be summarising the episode as some of the answers here have taken care of that.The major theme of this episode seems to sibling reunions.First things first, I cried happy tears when Jon & Sansa met. You could see it in Sansa's eyes the trepidation, the anxiety of whether she'll get to see her brother (half, anyway), after travelling all that distance. Is he really there? Will she finally reunite with a family member? And bam! there he is. Their meeting is a welcome relief after all the hits & misses that we've seen of the Stark kids over the 5-odd seasons. Though, honest question: did Sansa really tower over Jon while hugging or did he lift her up? Either way, looked a bit weird. The conversation that follows is amazing, though. Reminiscing and regrets, and a bit of forgiveness for perceived injuries. Sweet! Also, what is interesting is the way Sansa's character has shaped up. She seems to have made up her mind to take back Winterfell and rightfully so, after having endured the horrors right from King's Landing to Winterfell under the Boltons. She reminds Snow of the Wildlings who would back him and this shows the level of thought she's given to the matter. Epic character arc.Margaery & Loras. A resilient Margaery and a completely shattered Loras, in the dungeons of the High Sparrow. Quite interesting, though the High Sparrow plot is slowly becoming an unnecessary distraction in the larger scheme of things.And finally, the meeting of Theon & Yara. She's disappointed in him to say the least, and he's repentant. Will need to see whether Theon's support to Yara actually matters or not at the Kingsmoot coming up in the next episode.Tyrion and the Meereen plot doesn't add up to much. Except with Tyrion mouthing some clever lines. And really, Varys appeared just for one scene and didn't have a single line to say. What a sheer waste of talent! Wake up, D&D. This plot can really use a lot of improvements.Dynamic conversation between Davos, Melisandre and Brienne. Melisandre looks cornered by both Davos & Brienne, and Davos is left speechless when he comes to know that Brienne executed Stannis. Melisandre's probably shitting bricks when Davos asks her about Shireen. A little late in the day, don't you think? Whatevs.Dany, Jorah & Daario. Sigh! D&D are pyromaniacs. Seriously, she's the "unburnt"? Come on, GRRM was quite clear when he rubbished this theory, but no, D&D want Dany to emerge as the true hero (with boobs on display for added imagery). Not. It seems inconceivable that none of the Khals even touched Dany when she was on the brazier dropping spree. So what if they didn't have any weapons?! None of them even lunge at her. Great, big savage brutes that they are. Unbelievable shit. And wait a minute, what about Drogon? He was supposed to rescue Dany! So much for that, you sneaky trailer. Maybe the budget got exhausted in the pyrotechnics and they couldn't spring for Drogon to carry Dany, again. Maybe. Speaking of dragons, what happened to the ones Tyrion freed?Finally, the pink letter stuff. Predictable. Let's move on. We know there's a Bastard Bowl in the offing. Let's get to it NAAAOOW.The Lannisters-Tyrell, slimeball Littlefinger & the Ramsay & Osha plotlines don't warrant any of my time. Though, I can't wait for Sansa to cause Littlefinger's downfall.Arya and Bran don't appear in this episode at all. I expected at least Arya's plot to move forward this week, but looks like it'll happen next week. I eagerly await the leap in Bran's story in the next episode, which seems to be heading in a very exciting direction.So my rating for the episode, 3.5 out of 5. Extra 0.5 attributable to the eyes Tormund makes at Brienne while eating which makes her recoil and causes Dolorous Edd to shudder. Funny!
s06e04	One of the best shows of the season which I have watched so farSpoilers alertJon and Sansa finally met and their hugging scene marks for an emotional moment.I wonder how much love they have felt for each other after years of IsolationLittle finger had gone to House Arryn and manipulates the king of the house who is Catelyn’s nephew .He has something different in Mind. We all know the kind of strategist Little Finger is.Tyrion lannister again shows how tough negotiator he is by handshaking with the enemies of MeerenIn the king’s landing there was not much happening except for Jaime and Cersei Convinicing House Tyrell to go against High Sparrows and Kill themAnd in The End Daenerys Takes a hit at the Dothraki Men’s in Sacred Temple by Some fire and stole the show.
s06e04	Overall nice episode, but to me, four things stood out,The good,Sansa reunites with JonMargaery temporarily unites with LorasTheon reunites with YaraSibling power, yay!The bad,Where is Ghost? I was looking forward to the Sansa - Ghost reunion just as much. And why isn’t Ghost hanging around with Jon after he is resurrected? Is D&D trying to give us a clue about Jon or is it just about budget?The ugly,Dany is confirmed to be fire immune in the show. And the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen burns faster than a matchstick on a hot day. The fiercest warriors in Essos just scratching their &%$*^ waiting to be burnt. Drogon, I would have accepted, but this, nope, don’t accept it.The sick,Ramsay peeling the skin of the apple (=flaying) and throwing it away. Osha asks if he eats the skin of the people he flays. He smirks, and kills her, and then when he peels the skin of the next apple, he eats it. What is the audience to think?
s06e04	I thought it was great. Definitely the highlight of the season so far.The peak of the episode was the climax with Dany which people seem to be really bothered by. I get it, but I disagree.While this disagrees with what Martin has said about her abilities, there’s literally been nothing important in the books so far that depends on her not being fire-proof, so unless there’s something upcoming we don’t know about, this was always Martin being pedantic. Love the man, in awe of his abilities, but we all know full well that he has Dany live through that fire at the end of the first book because it’s an awe-inspiring scene, and realistically the character would be bound to try it again as needed afterward if she thought she had the ability - which she sure seemed to - and it was never realistic that she’d wait even this long to do it.To me this is the TV show asking themselves, “Wait, why aren’t we writing another scene like this?”, and then realizing they had no good reason not to do it.Additionally, while I understand that the Dothraki have always made people feel uncomfortable from a colonialist perspective, if someone set the room on fire around me, I don’t I’d act all that rationally either. It’s not about ignorant savages, it’s about having your reality turned on its head, and the very reason people enjoy the season is that its as true for the audience as it is for the Khals.I think it’s really nice to have Sansa & Jon not even reunited, but together for the first time - they never interacted before to my knowledge. I think it’s a bit much to have the unite at the same time when Rickon comes back into the picture, but that’s the kind of lack of subtlety I’m used to with the show.I’m hoping not-gone-Jon ends up being more interesting than simply a guy who is hesitant after getting hurt but then goes and wins a battle. I want him to actually surprise me in some kind of jaw-dropping way.
s06e04	The Daenerys segment was appropriately intense, with a decent ending. But the biggest problem with it was that Drogon is not involved. That seems incredible to me, especially given the name “Drogon” and the fact that he’s Dany’s metaphorical child - he’s the “Stallion that Mounts the World”. Drogon showing up to save her should be an incredibly auspicious sign, something that truly gets the Dothraki khalasars to bow before her in awe. But instead we get Dany walking naked out of the fire - a well-shot scene, but so much less than it could have been.The scenes in King’s Landing were very good, with a particularly excellent scene in the Small Council room. The only flaw was (yet another) monologue from the High Septon which ran a tad long, and only served to remind us yet again that he’s a religious fanatic.It was great to see Jon and Sansa re-unite, and I’m glad that they’re finally getting the “we should retake Winterfell” plot underway. Most of all, I’m incredibly happy that it’s Sansa pushing for this - it’s starting to resemble empowerment.In tandem with that, the show actually did a superb job of reintroducing the Vale and Littlefinger this episode, and getting them to march north to Winterfell and Sansa. The timing might not work out so well on that, but it’s good that it’s underway.Both Tyrion and Ramsay have the same problem, namely that they’re the show’s equivalent of the “Mereenese Knot” from the books: they’re treading water plot-wise, going nowhere and taking up valuable screen-time until other characters have been moved into the right positions by the plot. Ramsay’s clearly not going anywhere until he dies in the rumored “Bastard Bowl” battle (probably in the penultimate episode this season), and Tyrion doesn’t appear to be in any sort of rush to leave. The latter is especially strange in light of his letting the dragons off their leash - when is the show planning to fire that particular Chekhov’s Gun? But at least there’s some rationale for him to continue getting screen-time, unlike with Ramsay . We get it, Game of Thrones showrunners - he’s a bad guy, and we knew that before the last season even started. Did you think we were so enamored with Joffrey that everyone was begging for Joffrey 2.0?All in all, it was a good episode. I’d give it a 4/5.
s06e04	Meaty: that’s how I describe Season 6 Episode 4. Meaty and salty and leaving me thirsty for S6E5. This was the episode that felt like all the characters for whom I was crying “grow a pair” came through. There was Sansa finally, finally saying here’s our path to the future and we have to pull together. Sansa? Finally? Stopped combing her hair long enough to realize that if she left destiny to others again she’d be back in the flaying-arms of that Bolton bastard. And there was Daenerys finally stepping away from her “let’s all get along” detours freeing the slaves and getting freed herself. Without taking a moment to say thank you and give one of those thirsty boys a sweet kiss, she turned the tables on the Dothraki as the Mother of Dragons she is. Their arrogance has always been their weak point and they underestimated the pale beauty — won’t happen again! And how wonderful to see Brienne of Tarth get a break after all that wasted nobility. I have always wondered why nobody has been able to unseat the Sparrow and his religious stranglehold over King’s Landing — but now, finally, the disparate royal parties are beginning to coalesce. I mean: how could Tommen allow Margaery to remain another night in prison without a hairbrush and a good sarong? So, returning to the beginning of this very long paragraph, it is now time for Tommen to grow a pair, to face and to unseat a movement that in crusading against political corruption has grown fascistic. C’mon, even Theon Greyjoy has returned to his home, a flayed and broken man but wise enough to know that it is now time to surrender his own ego and support his fierce and, in her own way, loving sister. And on to tonight, S6E5, and, I hope, more Arya in the mix.
s06e04	Since the episode has not aired yet , I do not know the things that will be happening in it. Especially even before episode three. But if you are asking me what could happen in it. , here's my guess. The episode three is named as Oathbreaker. This episode may heavily feature Jon Snow after revival. Note that his oaths to Nights Watch have ended now that he has died. And will they be applied back on his resurrected form ?Perhaps no. Perhaps yes. He is technically free from his vows but he is Jon Snow. The loyal Watcher in the Dark. This question arises because no other Lord Commander has ever been brought back. ( tell me if it is so)The book of Stranger  , to me seems a Strange name. This episode might focus less on Jon and more on Daenerys or Tyrion. Tyrion and his books. ​This episode will be having some parts of the rising complications in the North , now that Ramsay is Lord Bolton. Also we would lead forward to Cersie's Trail , which will be happening in the latter half ( episode 8?)   Some more head smashing by Robert Strong could be seen too.
s06e04	The speculations for the next episode can be:- The Stranger is one aspect of The Seven in the Faith of the Seven, the predominant religion of Westeros. He is the aspect of the Faith’s god that represents the unknown and death.The Stranger is unique among the Seven in a few ways. While the other aspects of the Seven are human males or females, the Stranger is considered monstrous and does not have a defined gender (though he is referred to as male). As such, he is often depicted as a hooded figure with animalistic features.While follows of the Faith of the Seven frequently pay tribute to the various aspects of their god, few worship or offer tribute directly to the Stranger, finding him macabre and terrifying. Still, some societal outcasts identify with the Stranger, and he is considered one face of the Many-Faced God by the Faceless Men and devotees of the House of Black and White.The Faith’s holy text, The Seven-Pointed Star, is split into books that correspond to the aspects of the Seven. As such, the Book of the Stranger is the book corresponding to the Stranger. The episode being named after the holy book of what is essentially Westeros’s God of Death is ominous indeed.Another interesting note is that Sandor “The Hound” Clegane’s horse was named “Stranger,” though no one was ever certain if Clegane name the horse afterthe Stranger. Still, there are theories that the Hound is still alive in Westeros, so you have to wonder if this is a sly hint planted by the showrunners.Source:-  Game of Thrones: What Is The Book Of The Stranger?
s06e04	This is my first review of an episode this season so here goes.I found this episode to be very meh. It was unentertaining and felt like it was just going through the motions, giving us brief glimpses of the characters we love but nothing overly substantial in pyke, meereen, Brienne and kings landing.The best scenes involved Jon and Sansa. They felt the most natural or unforced. The same cannot be said for Danys bs way of becoming the great khaleesi of the dothraki.Personally I feel like the show is trying to juggle too many storylines and right now the show as a whole is suffering.Here's to hoping that by the end of the season they can right the ship because the first four episodes have been quite underwhelming to say the least.
s06e04	UPDATE After I’ve watched the episode, I’m so impressed! This episode is BRILLIANT, and by this time is the most epic, engaging and meaningful episode of the season (If we’re speaking about the whole episode, not about the epic ending, such as in E02)Image Courtesy: TeiIku at Deviantart (Daenerys Targareyen)Daenerys’s scene was really hot (in all senses), unexpactable and awesome. Her win was a shock for me, even though I was expecting that something WILL happen. Yeah, a simple escape by cover of night is not a MOTHER’S OF DRAGONS way.I have no pity for dead Khals, but I want to assume that Daenerys is really cruel with her enemies. Being so merciless with 3 dragons and huge army behind her back will let her to gain the Iron Throne back. But I’m not sure that Westeros will have a great time under her rule.JOHN, JOHN, JOHN AND FAMILY REUNIONIt was a sweet moment, when Sansa and John finally meet again. It was 5 seasons (!) ago, when they saw each other last time. Sansa finally understood, how silly she was, and John… After his resurrection he became a little bit emo. But with Sansa’s help, he admitted that they have to claim their home back.Ramsay’s letter (very similar to the original letter in the book) was a trigger to immediate actions. I’m so thrilled to watch The Battle of the Bastards!Image Courtesy: Art by Ertaç AltınözOSHA’S DEATHI expected that she will be killed, because after Ramsay had Rickon, there was no point in keeping her alive. However, the scene where she was trying to fool him and kill him was so promising!KING’S LANDINGThe Sparrows, Tyrells, Lannisters… so boring. It would be nice if the High Sparrow would be killed (don’t like this character at all), but while we have white walkers’ threat in the North, and dragons’ threat in the South, watching these political intrigue is not so pleasing.Hope, Margaery will be okay. Actually, when Tommen was saying something like that “Ma, High Septon talked to me and….” I was expecting that Margaery is already pregnant, and that’s why they don’t hurt her so much as her brother and will let her to go out of the dungeon.This situation would be a nice +1 strike to Cercey’s back. Because in this situation, she will be not only a mother of the king, but a grandmother to a future king (very lol situation for her, who is so feared of loosing her power and beauty)=======Here is my main speculations, written before the Episode was aired:======Speaking of the title, I'm 99% sure, that it's about The Stranger - is one face of The Seven-in-One God, representing the death and the unknown. Maybe the Book of the Stranger is some kind of the list, which contains dead people or men, who are destined to die.So it could be an allegory of someone's death, which is going to happen in the next episode (oh, what a surprise, isn't it? :) As for me, this title is should reveal us something concerning Arya in The House of Black and White as the Faceless Men respect the Stranger (unlike others). But in the episode description there's no any mention of Arya, so let it be more about allegory and metaphorical meaning.Besides, this title could be connected with the Sparrows, his leader The High Sparrow, The Faith of the Seven and fates of Margaery and Loras.So what we'll see in the episode?Tyrion, who will try to find new allies (as I think he is going to find a help from the mercenaries in exchange for some gold/other benefits) TRUEJorah and Daario that will fight for Dayneris ( I assume that one of them will die, as for me it will be Mormont *cry face*)TRUE (ACTUALLY, DAYNERIS CAN TAKE CARE ABOUT HERSELF ON THE HIGH LEVEL, BUT WITHOUT JORAH, DAAARIO AND THAT BEAUTIFUL YOUNG KHALEESI DANY’S EPIC SCENE COULD NOT HAPPEN EVER)Jaime and Cersei will try to 'show their power' and probably Olenna will confront with them. Maybe we'll see a suspiocious death of the Kevan Lannister (and Cersei will think, that it was planned by Tyrells) NOT SO TRUE, AS OLENNA SUPPORTED LANNYSTERS AND THERE WAS NO KEVAN’S DEATH/PARTLY TRUEHope, you've enjoyed my guesswork!
s06e04	As most of us are aware of the seven gods, The Stranger is an aspect of the Seven. He is rarely prayed to and represents death and the unknown. The other aspects of the Seven are depicted and represented by a human form but the Stranger is often portrayed in a wide variety, often frightening.Though it will be a long-shot but the coincidence that the Stranger might be a representation of the Others (White Walkers) and somehow Sam Tarly finds a book about them in Old Town. Must be a good read and highly recommended in the days to come in Westeros.Will have to wait and (nights)watch!!
s06e04	I always recap each episode of Game of Thrones, and this week is no different. Those reunions! That fire! My most important takeaway? Is Daenerys’ hair fireproof?It was an awesome episode…just enough spark and enough exposition. It was a vast improvement over the previous week’s hour, but then again, how do you top Jon Snow coming back to life? You can’t…you need to have a filler episode to make way for a show like “Book of the Stranger.”To read more of my snarky recap, feel free to read my entire review on my blog: http://seeheresthething.com/s6e4...

s03e09	★★★★★Shocking. Absorbing. Astounding. I'll start with the storylines then the filming then random thoughts and questions. I'm mainly focused on the wedding which doesn't mean the other storylines of Jon's betrayal of the Wildings or Bran's ability came out when pressed in a very beautifully told, freaked out moment with Hodor. Or Dany's storyline which was good too. THE WEDDINGWho are the savages?Red wine slips and sloshes on the banquet tables as rough-hewn glasses are roughly clinked. From a scene shot from the front of the hall, we see scraps of food littered in front of the tables on the floor. Coarseness, the juxtaposition of a celebration in a dirty place. The breaking of guest rules was fundamentally shocking. It took place in the same hall that they had been drinking and eating moments before. Something deeply grotesque about treating these people as guests, sharing food and wine and then killing them in the same area they ate and drank.   The repeated stabbing of Talisa’s womb. The general treatment of truly innocent Talisa. Brought forward like cattle to be examined. When they planned and executed to murder her with pinpointed cruelty. Shocking. Deplorable.  The Northerners are told stories about the Wildings; that they are these savage forest dwellers who drink blood from cups.  They are grey and complex people just like the rest of GRRM’s characters. Osha was so kind and loving towards the little Stark boys. She’s been nothing but kind and patient with Hodor (“Hodor!”) when he got upset. Orell may have been cast as bad but he was right. He was right to act the way he did towards Jon.  “At least let me stand up to die” said the horse-breeder to the Wildings. The Wildings allowed him to stand.  Compare that to the ambush of the Starks family by Freys. So nasty, so brutish.  Catelyn standing up to die before being gutted like an animal (like a fish? like a pig?), the blood gushing everywhere. They killed her son, she kept her promise and killed an innocent. She had an undignified death, she was not allowed to die with dignity.  Random vs planned acts of violenceReminder of Balor (Season 1, Episode 9). Ned Stark’s death. All this torment was triggered when Joffrey blithely ordered Ned Stark killed, almost off-handedly; the only planning an executioner with his sword at the ready. On the chess board, the Lions’ chess pieces all lined up against them, faces flat forward. This was not a chess board this was a butchering.  The amount of planning Lord Frey must have gone through to pull this off. In an almost macabre way “When the husband and wife leave, Fredrick, you shut the door. Now cue the band to start playing a creepy minor key song (Rains of Castamere). Then when I say and the signal, Peter, Jon and Hubert, you stab Talisa in the womb several times…” The way Walder Frey was watching the massacre as if he were watching a light play or a movie. Contrasts of matrimonial loveRobb Stark loved Talisa deeply. He foolishly broke his vow to marry the Frey daughter. The image of him crawling across the floor with arrows in his body to her broken body, to put his hand on her womb. Poor woman. Roose Bolton’s distain, lack of caring about his wife, shocked Catelyn.  Walder Frey couldn’t even be bothered to save the life of his wife. Women don’t matter to these men. Love doesn’t matter to these men. Arya - what can I say?Agonizing. This alone makes me want to watch until the end of the series. I want to see some vengeance by Arya for the pain she's suffered. Hopefully, vengeance touched with wisdom. The scene starts with Arya looking across the water, afraid she will not get to the Twins in time to see her mother and brother. Arya's worst fear did come true. She almost saw her mother and brother. Almost. That closeness, the way she trotted through the castle gates light-footed with excitement.  Then, soon after image of Arya crouched in between the barrels as soldiers run by with bloody swords, held straight horizontal. They are ready to do more damage.  The image of little Arya knocked out, flung over the Hound’s shoulder while behind them the Winterfell encampment burns The Hound coming back for Arya. Knocking her out so she wouldn't rush off and tried to kill three guards before being slaughtered herself. She would have done it. She would have rushed into the fray. FILMINGPerfect imagesThis episode was so beautifully shot, I want to think on it some more. I will have to come back and write about it later, maybe in a blog posting. Perfect actingMichelle Fairley sets the bar for acting. She is an amazing actress. That woman can tell a novel with her eyes.  I want to watch everything she does from now on, post-Game Of Thrones. The intensity of how she played that scene. It wasn't a scene, it was real. The truth of her throughout the entire episode, from reconnecting with her son to the final scene. And the final scene. The shock and rage in her eyes. The anguished wailing from Catelyn as she wanted to protect Robb and couldn't. The torment in her face as she saw her son Robb murdered in front of her. Catelyn. Dead stillness. She has died inside. We wait those few moments for what seems eternity. Please end, this scene is so awful. She is killed yet we know from her face, her body that she had already died.   Perfect scenesThe music plays, low, minor-keyed and ominous. Catelyn looks up shocked – I learn later it’s the Rains of Castamere. She grabs Bolton’s arm, pulls back the sleeve and sees the sheet-metal. She slaps him and yells “Robb”. MISC.Random thoughtsWhere is that Red Priest who can resurrect people? Catelyn….Arya and the Hound actually know each other very well.Rickon not wanting to leave Bran, wanting to protect Bran. Like Arya, in his mind, he is three times bigger and a hundred times stronger.Jon Snow not being able to kill a good man who is not in combat.Jon Snow pushing Ygritte aside immediately, Ygritte still hopeful, then her face, her face in the rain when she realizes that he’s left her, so easily left her.QuestionsWhy did Bolton say “The Lannisters send their regards”? Was he in contact with the Lannisters?The Bolton Bastard knows Rickon and Bran are still alive after Theon confessed during their pho-escape. Does his father Roose Bolton know? And do the Freys know?Did Ygritte kill the horse breeder so Jon wouldn't have to?
s03e09	★★★★Just saw it. Get ready, y'all.OK, so now that more people have seen it and the internet is ablaze, I'll add a few comments to this. I think it is fair to say that this is the part of the story all book readers were waiting for, and dreading at the same time, to see on the screen. They pulled it off pretty well, but I'll explain why I take a star off.Spoilers aheadFirst, the things I liked. Bran's warging was very well done - the scene with Hodor was a great surprise. I also liked Jon Snow's scene warning the farmer of the wildlings coming and making Ygritte miss the shot. Very nicely done, that. Arya + The Hound was perfect - they've done that extremely well. We all know Maisie Williams is great, but the guy playing Sandor is killing it too.What I did not like - Jon Snow betraying Ygritte. I think that scene just missed the urgency that I'd pictured when I read the book. It seemed like it was slightly rushed. They under-utilized Ygritte's acting capability at crunch time. Also, apart from the battle scene in Yunkai, nothing there stood out and was an unnecessary distraction. I wish they'd left out Dany from this episode.Now for the RW. The chapter describing this was a punch to the guts - I, and I think most other readers, were extremely affected when reading this, and it was this event that made these books like nothing else we'd read before. It is clearly the point where the conversion to die-hard fans of the series is complete for most readers.Keeping this impact in mind, the way it translated to the scene was a tad underwhelming. It was annoying knowing what happened in the books, for the first time ever. The pacing was fantastic - you could imagine sensing that something terrible is going to happen. The build up was very nice - the salt and bread, the other granddaughters, Roslin, and Edmure's reactions on seeing her and the look Walder Frey gives Robb Stark were awesome. The band playing 'The Rains of Castamere' was chilling and the buildup when the doors closed gave me goosebumps. Michelle Fairley's portrayal of Catelyn was spot on, she deserves an award for this. Arya being so close, but so far, was well handled too.BUT, it still missed something. Maybe it was the absence of Greatjon Umber's badassery of killing a number of Frey men. Maybe it was Grey Wind going down without a fight. Or maybe, it was just me feeling empty afterwards and nitpicking.
s03e09	★This is the episode that made me decide to stop watching this series. i tolerated the violence and sheer cruelty until now because the sophistication and the production quality balanced it, but this specific episode made me understand that this series, is a pornography of cruelty and evil. It is now one of those very popular TV series that though their high production quality, i refuse to watch - series such as Dexter, where the "hero" is a psychopathic serial killer, and breaking bad, were the main character turns deeper and deeper into the abyss of crime and Spartacus.It is not just about the violence. It is about the triumph of evil. About the cynicism and lack of moral ethic of the characters.The phenomenon of such pornographic evil is growing and although real acts of such  murderous and bloody behavior and utter lack of ethics were not uncommon in the dark days of Christianity and Islam (well... those days are not yet over for them, sadly) and exist even today, in some circles, in our over- capitalistic society, WE, as a society, should strive to evolve above and beyond that, as much as we can. While the way to do so is by harboring a mind that is less tolerant toward mind states that relish cruel situations and content that push our threshold of excitement/joy higher and higher, and thus making ourselves to numb and cynic to give compassion and sensitivity their right place in our hearts. The growing existence of such "picturesque" productions of gore and cruelty is  exactly what we don't need.The real danger, is when such shit is disguised behind sophistication and thus it gives excuses to continue watching it. The production is responsible. There is a lack of creativity in many writers and creators that is compensated by the cheap mob entertainment herb: pornography and especially gore.People, don't be a Colosseum type of mob. We are better than this. Let there be shows that are creative and good enough that will entertain us without the need to show mutilating people, "heroic" serial killers, murder of infants and the like!
s03e09	★★★★★I'm so happy for Samwell and Gilly. Really.At least there's one thing to be happy about. This episode had winter really coming. That wedding band really killed it tonight, didn't they?(some spoilers abound)I very much liked the execution of this episode, which started presumptuously on the edge of optimism and then went red as Walder Frey's wine. I commend the effort for keeping it slow and tense without falling into clichéd territory. The results are far more effective in this situation, and it paid off, slightly moreso now, having been disappointed for the first half of this season.The episode mainly focuses on the elegy of the Stark family sans Sansa.  It started with every bit of melancholy and a bittersweet feeling of demise which served to fuel the nerves (Robb and Catelyn Stark in their sweet, little moment of reconciliation together was rather pale and mushy) and then as the minutes went by the viewers are slowly lulled into these tiny comical moments in order to hide the atrocity that is about to ensue during the climactic wedding of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey.On the way to freedom is the youngest Stark daughter, Arya, who finds herself unwillingly together with Sandor Clegane in hopes to finally reunite with a part of her family that we've grown to care since the beginning. The whole episode revolved around this nostalgic feeling of wanting to finally reach a certain Homeward Bound-esque resolution for the Starks, and the viewers are intentionally led (or misled) just to reawaken us that we are watching this series because we want to see and hear about a wonderful fairy tale on how this family of honour and prestige struggled through the adversity of politics, of life, of circumstance and the harsh reality, and survived through it all.Unfortunately, no. We knew deep down in us they had it coming.  We knew that during the course of this season and from the events that transpired, something like this is bound to happen. And we knew that this would never end without the sacrifice of blood. We knew it all along and we rode with it just so we can witness it ourselves. Robb Stark may have won all his battles, but let's face it, he's no gamer of thrones.Meanwhile, Bran Stark and company had a different reunion with family in mind. It certainly ties things up together. For a moment as well, we could almost taste it. Bran Stark and Jon Snow being merely one step away from each other. Bran had finally awakened his senses as a warg, having mastered it in mere minutes after his first few tries. We finally heard his youngest brother, Rickon, speak. A revelation that the little boy is neither meek nor nondescript. But just as he had his own moment of glory, we see him and Osha walk off into the moonlight and towards a safer path, hopefully. The next moment, we find our resident spy who knows nothing, Jon Snow, despite his minor struggles as compared to his family, once part of the wildling pack (even shortly), now back to being the bloody crow he was always sworn to be, leaving his crow-wife Ygritte in an awkward rut between obsession and pride, but not without avenging himself with Orell, who didn't seem to be that bad of a guy since he was, after all, right, yeah? Poor Orell finds himself warging to his bird-pal right before dying, since wargs can technically do just that.Daenerys' short scenes here felt like an afterthought, a simple out-of-place element struggling to find a time or place to belong. We see her repeatedly gushing over her newfound confidant, Calvin Klein, I mean, Daario Naharis, while him and Grey Worm and Jorah Mormont took down the city of Yunkai with relative ease, but not without showing some fanciful swordfighting and spearthrusting choreography here and there. However, none of her scenes really seemingly affected anything that matters except only to serve to boost her ego and libido. And, yes, of course, to free the slaves of Yunkai, or so she says.Certainly there are some scenes I wish I could have wanted to emphasise more for the non-book readers, in this case, since they at least showed it. One example is the ceremonial eating of the bread and salt at the beginning of the meeting between the Starks and Freys. In the books, this practice is more of a religious practice than a mere gesture of hospitality; to harm a guest once they have eaten your bread and salt is rather indecent or sacrilegious. Catelyn urged Robb incessantly to quickly munch the grub as soon as they arrive to ease her of that lingering discomfort. I understand that perhaps they opted for a less foreshadowing path just so we can eat our throats once the climax reaches its peak. Effectively it did, and you could almost taste my tears from this sentence itself, let alone the absence of any audio while the closing credits pass us by.Finally, before the end could even roll, we once again empathise with the rabid Arya Stark, who, for two episode nines by now, have been subjected to the death of another Ned Stark. Poor Eddard Stark. We should have known it all along after what that foolish girl Talisa named their unborn child. Now Arya finds herself yet again stranded in a crossroad and into uncertainty. Her path may clearly be doomed, but she will yet rise above it. Valar morghulis.Some minor additions:No Lannisters in this episode, but make no mistake: This is the biggest Lannister episode of all.Roose Bolton smiled. I repeat, Roose Bolton smiled.Walder Frey was perfect. That shrug was disturbingly funny.I hate Lothar Frey more than I hate Walder.Mary Frey was hilarious.Roslin Frey was perfect.Edmure Tully is a tool.It was the perfect moment for a fish to pee, otherwise we would have witnessed a very short-lived Brynden 'Blackfish' Tully.Sam the Slayer is now Sam the Wizard. You will be missed, Grey Wind.Why watch Jorah swing it when we could finally have seen what Ser Barristan Selmy is capable of? We've never even seen him pump it louder on-screen yet.No Stannis. Rightfully so.No Theon. Expect more of him on the finale. Now don't be sad, it will all finally make sense.
s03e09	★★★Ever feel that things are going south to soon? That too much was happening at the same time. So much that you decide to take a walk, just to escape the suffocation; to stop, think and let your mind process the events in the right order of both- chronology and priority? That was my state when I first read the events of The Red Wedding.On TV though, I was simply disappointed (only a bit). When I pictured The Red Wedding in my mind's eye, through GRRM's narration, the flow of events from the celebrations of the wedding to the Quentin Tarantino style blood fiesta, was so smooth, ever so slight, that I actually had to turn back a few pages to see if I had somehow (hopefully) skipped a few pages and was reading the wrong chapter. The transition wasn't as smooth on the show. The bedding ceremony begins, the bride and the groom leave the hall, the musicians start playing "The Rains of Castamere", but the massacre wasn't immediate. There was just too much time lag- for Catelyn to recognize the song, of what it meant and of what was to follow. It wasn't supposed to happen like that. It was one of those "calm one moment, chaos in another" type scenarios that just wasn't milked for what it was worth.The actors' portrayal though was definitely impeccable. Michelle Fairley definitely deserves a standing ovation. Even if people who have never seen any of the episodes before started with the events of The Red Wedding, they would agree. The stabbing of Talisa in the stomach was a little too extravagant (she wasn't supposed to be there in the first place, she and Brynden Blackfish). The writers of the episode may have thought of including her to emphasize the injustice, the cruelty and the barbarism of the Freys and of Roose Bolton. But with the events that follow, they needn't have bothered. I suppose to the viewers that haven't read the books, it was a powerful catalyst in creating hate against the perpetrators, but to me, it was just one murder too much.I don't say they were wrong to use Talisa's killing as a rallying point to enrage the viewers. It's just that there was another contender for that already and they down-played it. The show never really emphasized on Robb's relationship with his direwolf, Grey Wind. Not that I enjoyed the way they executed him, but they could have just stuck to the books for this part of the show. Grey Wind isn't your average stray dog that you put down with just a few crossbow bolts. In the books, he actually takes down as many Frey men as he can before they finally get him. (When I was reading this part of the story, I was actually hoping he would break free from his chains and rescue Robb. But he doesn't and there I was- disappointed again. But that is what made me appreciate the genius that is GRRM. That's what they should have shown. It would have given the viewers hope that everything may not yet be lost- only to be disappointed again. To appreciate reality). The Stark wolves aren't just a piece of decoration on the show- the fact that the sigil of the Starks is the direwolf and that Bran, Arya and Jon can warg into their wolves isn't just a coincidence. That was one major setback. Apart from the time lag, between the bedding ceremony and the massacre, and Grey wind's execution, I have no other complaints. This was definitely one episode that had me feeling waves upon waves of goosebumps despite knowing already what is to happen. Satisfied but not overly excited about it-which is why I give it a three out of five.P.S: Did anyone else think Roslin was way more beautiful (and hotter) than Talisa??
s03e09	★★★★It was bound to happen. Ned Stark had broken the very basic rule. You do not break the treaty with an ally when you already have very few of your allies left. He should have thought about it which he blatantly ignored. His mother had done another big mistake by releasing Jaime Lannister. She should have thought, that the king who cut her husband's head off without any treason would not let her daughters go gracefully in exchange of his Uncle(father)!Arya is safe outside all this. That's one big reason she is not dead yet or bound in a marriage, which is laugh of the town.And just imagine, if the penultimate episode is this, then surely something bigger than this can be expected in the last episode which can create more anxiety in everyone's mind about Season 4
s03e09	Certainly one of the best episode of GOT ... Second only to episode 9 of season 1 ...Reason of considering season1 episode9 the best is obvious : YOU DO NOT KILL THE LEAD ACTOR IN THE BEGINNING OF A MOVIE... N if u r doing it, u better give the viewers a reason to still watch the rest of the movie ... N GRRM certainly knows the way to keep his viewers glued to the seats ...N who says lightning never strikes twice the same place...Ask the Starks... Episode 9 season 3 proved to be one of those situations only... Killing not one .. not 2 .. nor 3 but 4 Starks ... U simply Dnt kill so many leads unless u r GRRM ...
s03e09	★★★★★I was completely heartbroken when I saw this episode and frankly I didn't see this coming.. NOT AT ALL!!I genuinely like House Stark and especially liked Eddard Stark but the way things have unfolded on Starks, I feel sorry for them but I guess this is what they call "The Real Game of Thrones"The episode was directed with utter perfection specially "Red Wedding" - kudos to the director for that. This episode has no role of Tyrion for which I'm sad because he is the only guy I like now. Also no mention of Jamie. Arya acted very well here.I am desperate to watch the finale now. Sunday please come fast!!!
s03e09	★★★★★I thought that was one of the most memorable episodes of TV ever.2nd-best episode of Game of Thrones ever (2nd only to Season 1 Episode 9).I can't remember an episode of TV where so many main characters are killed off all at once. I *never* saw the Red Wedding coming, even as the episode built up, which is the highest praise I can give.The pregnancy tragedy was especially brutal and real. Gasp. The tender exchanges between Robb/his mom and Robb/his wife made this episode truly heartbreaking.
s03e09	★★★★★Non-spoiler review in gif form.
s03e09	★★★★Well i am not going into every details except the story(bcoz i think else-they do it perfect).Full points to story writer and director for gr8 screenplay and sudden outburst in the season.....When the sudden massacre happened, i was like - have i missed any episodes?? but then soon when i gained my conscience, i thought that it was getting quite boring to have starks still crawling and not reaching their goals....;), so good and also it leaves less members to be remembered int GOT.And next thing due to which i liked it was now there remains only one favourite contender for throne and that is khalisi....At last to wrap up thumbs up to whole GOT team...love your show very much.
s03e09	★★★★★After watching the episode my reaction was :Gut wrenching to see Starks die one by one without even doing anything in return to harm Lannisters. Great episode nonetheless.
s03e09	★★★★★It came in such a shock, especially since it wasn't the last episode of the season. I got used to be surprised at the last episode of the season. Besides, when I saw what happened, I just regretted not reading the book. This was the one part of the series that I haven't read. But all in all, I give this episode an honest, well-earned A*. Hands down, this was indeed one of the best finale ever done on a TV show.
s03e09	★★★★★I'm still in shock. I have never read the books, so the ending caught me totally by surprise.The killing of Robb's pregnant wife was  particularly unnerving. I thought the ending credits w no music playing was brilliant and appropriate. Fantastic episode.
s03e09	★★★★★Pre-emptive.If they get this episode wrong (i.e. less than 5 stars), I'm not watching the series anymore.
s03e10	★★★★This episode was a clear wrap up. It was a clean up after the gruesome massacre that was the Red Wedding. It also set the stage for the next season. I liked the overall pace of the episode- silent, not too emotional or exciting, mourning. I liked the way the scenes transitioned from one character to another that was being talked about previously. They showed Grey Wind's head on Robb's body! I was thinking that wasn't going to happen(but someone posted a spoiler image a few days ago). I wish they had shown a closeup of Robb's body with the direwolf's head. But the fact that the head was not stitched on properly was that much more defiling. If the head had been sitting perfectly on the body's shoulders, it would still have looked regal. I'm so glad they didn't continue with the scene showing Theon's castration from the previous time. All this gore makes me squirm. We finally know that his captor is Ramsay Snow, bastard son of Roose Bolton. And you have a of-course-which-other-family-could-the-psychopath-belong-to moment. The guy has such a charming face, but you just want to take a war-hammer and smash it in. Or at least give a slap(and get the hell outta there instantly). The scene with the sausage was just utterly gross. Great acting. There's not a lot of characters you really hate, but this is one of them.Another character you want to slap is Joffrey. He's an annoying gnat you just want to flick away with your fingers because he's distracting you from the important things to be discussed at the Small Council.  (I still hate the fact that they showed him as a murderer(Ros) which was not in the books).  His scenes are always handled carefully with just the right amount of humor, and this was no exception. It's wonderful to see him being put down, and more often than not, it's Tyrion who's doing that. Even in the books, their exchanges were witty and chuckle worthy. Tyrion and Tywin always manage to have the best lines- clear and sharp. "Any man who must say 'I am the King' is no king" was a punch in the gut for the whiny little boy. "You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper." was a laugh. And Tywin's retort was witty and powerful as ever - "You really think a crown gives you power?". And the moral conundrum he poses : "Why is killing 10,000 men on a battlefield more honorable than killing 10 men at dinner?" Tywin is the real ruler and knows how to gain power. He's a sneaky bastard who resorts to trickery and has recently stooped to a really low level, but he has the real power. Not Joffrey, not Cersei, not Tyrion, but Tywin. Ygritte and Jon Snow have a clashing of honors episode. Jon goes on to explain why he must go back although he loves her. It is his honor and duty. Ygritte stays quiet the whole time, listening, and her notch on her arrow speaks in reply. When Jon, finally confident that she will not shoot because he has explained to her about his honor turns back, she loses an arrow without saying a word, but effectively telling him that it is now her honor and duty to shoot him. He betrayed her, and if she lets him go, she will not be doing her duty. She is a wildling out and out, after all. But with every arrow she shoots, you can feel her pain and rage and her want to hurt him- hurt him like he hurt her. It was gut wrenching to watch. It would have been an outrageously tactless move by the producers had they left Jon's life as a cliffhanger this season, but thankfully, they showed that he is alive. Ygritte's expressions were a perfect ten on ten. The Jaime - Cersei scene could have been done much better(in the books, Jaime comes back much later, and they impulsively have sex), but Jaime's hopeful stare and the look of revulsion on Cersei's face as she looked at Jaime's arm conveyed a lot about the nature of their future relationship. When Jaime looks down at his stump, you could almost hear him say, "You too take me now for a cripple and feel disgusted because my hand is chopped off, Cersei?"Yet another character who conveyed a lot with his expressions alone was Tyrion. He had just gotten Sansa to talk cheerily with him, and is so hopeful that they can get through this together after all, when he sees her tear-stained eyes. The guilt in his face is palpable. Both Tyrion and Sansa's expressions were also perfect tens. Arya and the Hound were, well, what can I say? Awesome. Arya is one headstrong girl, a fighter and a survivor. There is so much anger in her. And so much has been taken away from her. She is going to do everybody in one day, you just know it. I loved the way she used her filthy appearance to get the man to face her before she stabbed him. Looks like the Hound has some new-found respect for her.Bran's Rat Cook story talks about what a lowly act killing guests is. It leads us to hope that Lord Frey is going to meet a gruesome end. Bran meeting Sam was a wonderfully positive feeling for the viewers. Sam's re-recital of the vows to Maester Aemon makes you go, "Aww shucks!" because you really want Sam and Gilly to get together. The very implied manner Sam convinces Maester Aemon about the white walkers was in complete contrast with his lines with the blunt Jojen Reed. Sam has become even more endearing, if that's possible.There was a lot of defying going on too. Joffrey, of course, was stupid in telling his grandfather that he hid under Casterly Rock while Robert killed Rhaegar. (For those who do not know, when Robert killed Prince Rhaegar, Tywin was a recent Hand of the Mad King Aerys. Using his calculating and dishonorable methods, he marched into King's Landing, welcome, and sacked the city. Jaime then slew Aerys, but for honoroble reasons. Lannisters killed the king, Robert killed the prince.) The scene with Varys and Shae was surprising and unexpected. Lord Varys does not concern himself with smaller beings who are not a big part of his plans. The fact that he came to talk to Shae and tried to bond with her using the we-are-both-aliens-here lines show that there is something important he wants to do and Shae is hindering that. He went as far as paying her to leave, and she defied him. You can't help feeling she's going to pay for it. Either that, or she has ulterior motives. Or is just plain stupid. Her story should be interesting to watch out in the next season. I really liked how Ser Davos connected with Gendry. The scenes between them provided a light comedic relief to an otherwise sombre episode. Davos also openly defies Stannis and sends the boy to safety. He is defiant still when Stannis pronounces his death sentence, and it was relieving to watch that the guards don't react immediately. Melisandre wasn't upto her usual tricks this time. She very tactfully played with Stannis and ended up having Ser Davos serve in her army. It was an ultimate, personal insult to him, and a triumph for her. But I was not too convinced with Melisandre switching sides in an instant. How did she not see in her fires that the North is in danger? I did not really like Yara's portrayal in the series. She is much more playful and spunky in the books. And I definitely don't like that they showed her going against her father. Balon Greyjoy did not favor Theon for sure, but in the books, Asha was his favorite. Ah, well. At least, it was well done. Balon's lines went on to reinforce the disregard many kings and lords hold for their own family. Walder Frey talks along the same lines about his wife. These people value power and wealth over their own kin. Ironically, it is the man who has power and wealth who values his family members. Tywin's statement to Tyrion about his childhood was completely unexpected. It left you feeling even more confused for your feelings towards Tywin. Cersei's lines about motherhood were moving, especially when she described how even Joffrey cannot take away how she used to love Joffrey himself. She conveys clearly how much she used to adore him, and how she's still clinging on to that memory of her sweet little boy, despite the fact that he's now a monster. Cersei is a mother. Her lines give her actions a little bit of retribution and viewer sympathy. But that went away the instant we saw her judging Jaime for his broken hand. Yet another character shows that power and looks are more important to her than the love he bears her.Dany's scene was completely over the top. I did not like this at all. Frankly, the expressions on the faces of the extras were just not believable. It was too overdone. She has been exalted to the status of Mhysa, but not tastefully. However, the closing CGI scene was quite impressive.I think pretty much every major character and every plot was covered in this episode. Overall, a good ending to the tumultuous season.
s03e10	★★★MothersAs we learn at the end of the episode, Mhysa means mother. This is a reference to Dany and how she was received by the newly liberated people of Yunkai. We also get a taste of the relative happiness Cersei gets from being a mother, even of Joffrey. This is in stark contrast to where we were left at the end of the Red Wedding, bearing witness to the most abject horror a mother can have–Catelyn seeing her child and unborn grandchild slaughtered before her eyes. The contrast is a bit twisted; on one hand, there's some hint of happiness left in the world. On the other, we are in fact just gaining more insight into the joy that was completely eviscerated at the Red Wedding. It's as if the producers are setting us down gently but subtly reminding us not to forget.FathersHowever, another major theme of this episode is fathers, and how poorly they receive their own sons, intentionally (Tywin, Balon) or otherwise (Roose, Davos). Just when you think Tywin couldn't be a more cruel father to Tyrion, he reveals to Tyrion that he would have drowned him right from the beginning were it not for the fact that he is a Lannister. He keeps pushing and pushing on Tyrion, and you can't help but think that Tyrion is going to eventually push back, in a cumulatively forceful way. This will be the dynamic to watch next season."Just Like You"The rest of the episode is melded together by unlikely pairs that hold more in common than either would think. Davos and Gendry, Arya and the Hound, Varys and Shae, Bran and Sam.It's clear that Arya's been pushed over the edge; the amount of inconsolable anger she has makes the Hound look timid by comparison. This is the other storyline to keep a close eye on in season 4.At the end of season 2, we were teased with a looming threat that seemed bigger than all of the petty politics going on in the South. At the end of season 3, it's still coming, and no one's really done anything about it. They're just starting to get their shit together at the Wall, and it's unclear if anyone's going to take them seriously.Let's get one thing clear–the Red Wedding was the true end of this season. However, this episode was necessary to placate distraught fans and lay some extremely early groundwork for the next season. I thought it was OK, but relatively speaking, it's impossible to have followed up the previous episode with anything nearly as good.
s03e10	★★★★Once you accept that there aren't a lot of Big Happenings in an Episode 10, and it's more about moving pieces around the chessboard to set up next season, I thought it was a brilliant episode in terms of the character interactions.THE GOODThe Small Council scene was probably the one that sticks out most because it's Tywin Lannister at his best and worst. Smacking down Joffrey like the petulant child he is was was fantastic, but you can tell Joffrey struck a nerve -- "winning a war with a quill and ink" and "hiding under Casterly Rock" are really two sides of the same coin when it comes down to it. It's two perspectives of Tywin's leadership style. And then Tywin's heartbreaking answer to Tyrion's question at the end of the scene just blew me away. (And as an extension of that scene, the despair of that scene after when Tyrion returns home to Sansa, understanding just how hopeless and trapped they are... sometimes it's amazing what these actors can accomplish without even any lines.)Arya's big scene. Is it just rage or a moment of clarity? There aren't going to be any reunions. Robb's not going to lead a Stark army to cross those names off that list -- if anything the list just gets longer and longer, unless she takes matters into her own hands. The Hound's reaction is a touch toward "buddy cop movie" territory, but still. I don't recall the scene between Varys and Shae in the books (it might have been there, it might not) but I thought it was a nice little add. I always like when Varys' humanity shows throw and he's willing to set aside his Master of Spies hat to help his friends* (and his respect for Tyrion was nice to see), and he can see that Shae hanging around can't POSSIBLY end well for her, Sansa, or Tyrion. Perhaps he's still stinging from what happened to Roz.Lena Headey also brought her A game, both in the scene with Tyrion where she lets her guard down a little about Joffrey, and when Jamie returns. You can tell, even now, just from her expression at seeing him again, that things won't ever be the same between them. There's no running into each other's arms -- more of a mutual "who the f*** are you"?I thought the Stannis-Davos-Melisandre storyline was a little uneven, but ultimately hit some good notes. It was nice to see Davos stand his ground and set Gendry free, even knowing it would cost him his life. And you know what... for as much as we get the vibe from Stannis like he only wants the throne because he's next in line, the line where he says (paraphrasing) they made his kingdom bleed and he'll use any weapon he can to pay them back... at least it shows he's got a beating heart and isn't just the Stannis-Bot 2000.THE LESS-GOODFor the most part, I didn't dig the scene between Jon and Ygritte. I guess I wonder a little... did she shoot to kill (three shots and not one hit in a vital spot?) or did she shoot to hurt him for leaving her behind. All that said, "I love you and and I know you love me" made Anakin Skywalker look like a smooth talker.I just don't care much about the Theon subplot, though his dad is one cold S.O.B. I'd care a bit more about his sister being all gung-ho to find him if they'd developed that relationship a little more.I thought they'd do a bit more with Daenerys than just have another YAY MOTHER OF DRAGONS! scene. Maybe explore the ramifications of Jorah getting friend-zoned in favor of Daario or something... they were hinting at that in Ep9.Less Sam and Gilly, please.SUMMARYA lot of interesting exploration of what family means, and to a lesser extent, what a highborn name gets you.There's a whole lot of highborn people being intolerably cruel to people within their own families. One king is willing to serve his uncle's wife the head of her dead brother at a wedding just to find some way to take credit for his grandfather's victory. That same grandfather tells his son his one great sacrifice for the family was not murdering him as an infant. Another "king" (Stannis) is willing to burn his nephew alive to make some deal with mysterious powers. A third king (Balon Greyjoy) is willing to sacrifice his son to torture. Walder Frey has a good laugh about murdering his son-in-law's family and holding him hostage in a dungeon.Meanwhile, it's the people who don't have a name to trade on that treat each other decently -- either they're lowborn and don't have one at all, or in some cases they're high-born, but their name doesn't help them much. Davos saves Gendry at the risk of his own life. Sansa (family dead) and Tyrion (the black sheep of his family) are both trapped but there's at least some kindness there that neither gets from anyone else... well, except Shae, but that's awkward. Varys tries to get Shae out of the line of fire. Arya and The Hound have reached a peace for the moment. And no one's rallying behind Daenerys because of the Targaryen name -- they're following her because she's offering freedom to people who never had it.
s03e10	★★★★★I want to talk acting here.  One thing I like about science fiction and fantasy on film is that actors are given really interesting challenges, their characters are placed in extraordinary circumstances and they must come up with a way of reacting to these circumstances that pulls a viewer in through empathy, compassion, even revulsion which works best if one can understand the humanity behind a terrible act.  The Red Wedding is arguably the most horrifying scene in television history, yet Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister contextualizes the murderous acts in that scene as understandable moves in 'The Game'.  As Tywin and Peter Dinklage's Tyrion spar over the morality of the events past and those proposed for the future you got to see two excellent acting performances, characters so finely tuned that the fantasy aspects of the story are transcended by the humanity revealed.  Tywin is tied to duty, duty to the family.  If that duty requires brutality you apply it.  And if it requires mercy, mercy for a deformed infant, you apply that as well.  It was the revelation of Tywin's act of mercy that left Tyrion speechless.  Damn!  Great stuff!Yet the brutality of The Game isn't so easily brushed aside.  When Tyrion goes to Sansa he is obviously conflicted.  They must talk.  But when he whispers her name and she turns her head words fail him.  This was what we actors call a moment.  Her glance is fleeting, lasting mere seconds, yet upon her face can be seen unutterable sorrow, grief beyond words, and yet, around the edges, defiance.  Sophie Turner has taken a character that was initially as deep as water on a plate and made of her a well, with darkness and light within its depths.Duty again asks a terrible price, paid by Jon Snow and Ygritte.  He broke his vow, fell in love with her and took that step too far.  But he can't escape the vow.  When Ygritte looses her arrows she does so with more than the simple rage of the spurned lover, she has duties too: to her people, to herself and to the stark code of the warriors beyond The Wall.  Both Rose Leslie and Kit Harington were able to produce a wonderful chemistry between their characters.  Such chemistry can be very elusive, but when it's there it can be so sweet.  And that sweetness makes the severing of their bond all the more tragic.There was great acting all over this episode-Lena Headey's Cersei reveals layers that include a blunt cruelty, a mother's love for a monster that was once the light of her life and a practical sense of the way things are for a woman in her position.  The actress has been able to bring us a villainess at once evil, yet understandable in her motivations.Sam and Gilly have an unusual relationship in that it is platonic, something rare in nighttime drama.  John Bradley and Hannah Murray are so easy with one another, so comfortable.  It's quite lovely.I loved the scene between Davos and Gendry where we get insight into the lowborns of the realm.  Too often in epics the worldview presented is based on the elites, the ruling class, with little attention paid to the lives of lesser folk.  Liam Cunningham and Joe Dempsie develop a nice camaraderie and provide a window onto the gutters and back alleys of Westeros.The relationship developing between Arya and The Hound, Maisie Williams and Rory McCann, looks to be one of the most promising aspects of season IV.Gemma Whelan set the stage nicely for next season as Yara Greyjoy.  I thought she asserted herself with a steely resolve.  She got a lot across in a few moments.I'm a sucker for any freeing of slaves stuff so I continue to find Emilia Clarkes' Daenerys compelling.  Her growth as a character has been nice to watch.So I give the episode 5 stars mostly for the acting.  The piece as a part of the story had a definite epilogue quality to it after the earth-shattering events of the previous episode.  But dang, the producers of the show packed a bunch of fine acting performances into 'Mhysa'.
s03e10	★★Spoiler alert: Khaleesi still isn't going anywhere close to Westeros soon. Sad really.The final shot was disappointing that I clenched my nerd hands wishing I could have done a more satisfying finale (not that I could) than the one they offered. Seriously, I have no idea why they opted to go for the campy Daenerys Targaryen and The Three Musketeers storyline to close the season. There were far better opportunities to be had, especially now that so many things make a wee bit of sense. The 'oh shit' moments of the first and second season finales got buried along with the forever young. I personally would have opted to go with Coldhands or Stoneheart (wink).The episode overall felt wrought with anticlimax. The only thing that worked basically is tying the knots together for those less fortunate to not have read the books. Yet there was nothing for me to be excited about for the long wait. Some events here are even misleading and perhaps giving a false sense of hope for some characters and viewers alike. It feels as though they gave me desserts without a main course, especially after having blown away by their specialty last week.There were things I did really like though; reappearances of relevant secondary characters; Aemon Targaryen, Pyp, and Balon and Yara Greyjoy. It definitely proved that it's better not to see characters for some time rather than cram them into an episode with little to no relevance.The Arya Stark and Sandor Clegane duo in this episode was short but not sweet. After the shocking events of the previous episode, a man would expect to see the transformation of little tomboy Arya Stark channelling her killer instinct. Note that this isn't the first time in this series that Arya had killed a man, but this time she finally did it out of spite, absent empathy and emotion, as The Hound cheers on from behind. The Theon Greyjoy saga finally came to a conclusion, but was it satisfying? It reeks of ugh and gives us more headaches than palatable answers.Jaime Lannister's return to King's Landing was sweet, especially how amazed Qyburn and Brienne were at the sight of all that hay and marble. Duh. The dynamics between Tyrion and Tywin Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon held this episode on its own. It will definitely carry on to the next season. The North remembers and there will be pies to eat.Meawhile, it's good to finally hear that the Stannis side of the story is propelling forward. It's very disappointing to say farewell to Gendry though (or is it?), not just because he is an important figure but the actor really gave him the credence to become one. It is also disappointing to realise that Shireen was shown in this episode just to show Davos why there is a letter G in the word night.Bran and company now find themselves in an interesting journey yet still feels shallow and bizarre for my taste. They just walked all the way from start to finish, and a scare for their lives now and then could have spiced things up.Then Jon Snow confronts Ygritte for what could have been a schmaltz run, but instead we see a more dramatic exit for our wildling-loving crow, who sees return to Castle Black, but not before receiving three arrows to his body. Either Ygritte is trying to say 'I love you' or 'You know nothing' for each arrow, both still applies.Then finally we see a view of a short-lived optimistic Sansa who received word of her ill-fated family in the brink of extinction. If the screen hung on for another five seconds there I would have shed a tear, but thank you for sparing me that liberty.This episode in its entirety to me feels representative of the entire third season. Mildly engaging and interesting banter topped with a death of two here and there.  We get to see Yunkai finally liberated, but, hey, who cares about Yunkai when the war had ended on the other side of the continent? These talks of dragons and slaves pale in comparison to some deaths of wolves.
s03e10	★★★★Overall a good, satisfying episode. More subdued but well-written,all scenes subtlety stitched together.  Almost musically paced exact, like a metronome. Third episode in a row written by David Benioff & D.B. Weiss. The visual cutovers this week were impressive – like . It didn't have a cliffhanger ending like the finales of Season 1 with the birth of the dragons or Season 2 with the attack for the whitewalkers. Most likely because, as a friend pointed out, it's really like the middle of Book 3. THEMESMothersDany, mother of the dragons and now to the freed slaves. Sam bringing Gilly, a mother, to Castle Black, Cersei and her talk of being a mother will bring happiness to Sansa and then her own brief happiness with Joffrey when he was everything to her. Even Yara who was acting like a mother to Theon by going after him (I believe she said once she remembered him as a little baby)Kickass womenArya attacking the men, Yara decisively to the rescue, Meera coming across the plains with her arrow and the direwolf, Ygritte who acted accordingly even if Jon Snow is to be the hero, the Red Priestess who I understand more and more is doing this because she believes its rightUnlikely alliesArya & Sandor (an orphan and an unlikely father-figure), Davos and Gendry (a man who’s lost his son and another orphan). The Red Priestess taking Davo's side.Feigning weaknessArya dropping the coin, Grand Maester Pycelle playing feeble and dropping the scroll with the important news.CloakingEdmure Tully easily cloaks Roslin; he couldn’t protect himself against a surprise attack and is in a dungeon. Tyrion couldn’t cloak Sansa without her help but he protects her against Joffrey’s cruel plan to present her with her brother’s head. And he stands up against his father against raping her to pass on the family line.FAVORITE SCENESArya and Sandor taking on the Frey menArya was unexpectedly resourceful. She reacted emotionally on overhearing the man boast how he (and a couple of other guys) stitched the wolf’s head to Robb, her brother’s body. When she jumped off the horse and crept up behind him, I thought she was going to attack him immediately. Instead, she approached the situation with cunning, using her lost orphan status to her advantage – “I just want some food” then fumbling and dropping the coin before savagely knifing him to death. The vengeful death was satisfying.  She still doesn’t think it all the way through though – what was she planning on doing with the other three men? I don’t believe she had thought it through to have Sandor follow her. Though she was resourceful enough to steal the knife before she needed it.The coin! The phrase! I’m looking forward to seeing what happens to Arya from here on out.Earlier, the image of Arya’s eyes displaying aching horror and pain when she saw the cruel defiling of Rob’s body with the wolves. Sandor thinking quickly and grabbing the Frey banner to charge out of there.Yara Greyjoy standing up to her father and leaving to rescue TheonBalon Greyjoy is not a wise man. He repeatedly made bad choices which put his children directly in harm’s way: killing two sons for a stupid rebellion, then sending Theon off to take the North.  That Balon wasn’t going to take any responsibility for Theon when he was in desperate need just galled me. I loved that Yara stood up to him, I thought she was going to push him in the fire at one point. And I loved that she took the fifty top killers and marched onto the ship.What and how Balon said with disgust that Theon wasn't a man, couldn't do anything for the family line, that must have impacted Yara, a woman. Tyrion and Sansa The walk in the gardens was bittersweet, as we knew it was to be ruined. Her joining in on his side to find a revenge. Her sharing of her childhood experience with Arya and the sheep dung in the bed. It shows she’s not far from there, still a child, yet oh so far away. Sansa on the window sill, looking out the window, then turning to reveal a face red raw and covered in tears. I almost wish he’d gone to her when she was crying  - I know he couldn’t have, could he?The small council meetingPerfect, there was a whole season in this scene from Joffrey’s smarmy strut and disgusting suggestion, to Tyrion’s defence of Sansa, to Cersei’s powerlessness to rein in her son’s impulses, to Tywin bringing order by sending the King to bed without his supper, to Tywin and Tyrion’s buildup of tension.The acting in the scene where Tywin says he wanted to walk the baby Tyrion into the sea. Such intensity. I felt for Tywin's character and Tyrion.Shae and Vary’s character developmentThat scene said much about both of their characters. I’ve really come to like Varys. I believe he does want the stability of the kingdom and can predict using his hard-ended wisdom. He’s a strategist. He's imploring her to leave based on his experience and knowledge.  I loved the beautiful backdrop of the sea and the orange and yellow awning. So tranquil and beautiful for conflict in the scene.The musicWorth a call out on it’s own. Beautifully done with the music overlaid Dany’s being carried on the arms of her new people.ALMOST, NOT QUITE SCENESShae's character, she bothers me. What is her end game? Does she really not know Tyrion well-enough that he'd never send Varys? The scene with Jaime coming into Cersei’s room. It just wanted something from the filming and the timing. Last episode, the camera lingered exactly right. This scene just didn’t have tempo or setting or something. I wanted this to be more and it just wasn't.Dany’s scene. It didn’t work. For some reason, it just didn’t work. It had everything – from gorgeous almost edible music to beautiful scenery, and yet, it felt kind of cold to me.DISLIKED The grotesqueness of castration by the Bolton Bastard. Ramsay Snow castrated Theon in a horrific awful manner. Blood, eating the sausage, even just being there. Overdone. The scene with Yara receiving the box would have been perfect on it’s own. We could have all understood.RANDOM THOUGHTSWho told Sansa of her brother and mother’s deaths? Who would have known? Only the small council right? Joffrey was taken to bed and given milk of poppy by Grand Maester Pycelle. Cersei was in her room, playing with seashells. Varys was talking with Shae?The defiling of Robb’s body with the wolf. This is heinous and yet other cultures even today, this happens. I remember my grandfather being very upset that a policeman’s head was put on a spike in England. Why does this happen? I’m not sure if I really want an answer.Are sociopathic babies any different from other babies? I know there are sociopath indicators in children like tormenting and killing small animals, setting fires.
s03e10	★★★Thanks for the A2A Marc. Note: I'm coming at this as a reader. I won't spoil, but clearly my expectations are based on a continued love affair with the books beyond this point.I thought the end here was adequate but not more. To me the best season of GoT is still Season 1 and I say that so freely because all three seasons have ended formulaically with an epic climax and then an attempt at a smaller peak which acts to induce catharsis.In Season 1 we had the second best climax (Headless Ned), but the catharsis was stunning. Seriously, Dany walks out of a fire wearing nothing but fresh dragons? Praise to the Old Gods and the New.Season 3 has the best climax with the Red Wedding - a singular moment in TV history for me - my lord if I had any power to say who got Emmies, Michelle Fairley would get one - but the final episode kinda drifted a bit.The catharsis is supposed to be Mhysa Dany, and it's a good scene, but it's not really enough for me. You had other things that made it in the episode which didn't fully hit. Jaime seeing Cersei for example maybe could have been an amazing moment but they both seemed to just wait for the camera to switch away.The good:Cersei advising "giving" Sansa a kid and then talking about her own gratitude for her kids. Wow.The Hound bailing out Arya and then telling her to give him a head's up next time...she decides to murder a group of men they pass by. Aww. I had the Archie Griffith theme song pop into my head.Joffrey being sent to bed.Ygritte shooting Jon in a manner that said "I love you THIIIIIS much"...repeatedly.
s03e10	★★★★★I loved this episode.  It was a beautiful capstone the season.  This episode went at a break neck pace.  All the major characters were hit upon and significantly advanced.We saw the aftermath of the Red Wedding through the eyes of Arya.  It's amazing how one episode can seem so far away and at least I had already come to grips that the House Stark.  We see the famous scene of Robb's body with his direwolf's head.   We see Arya's blood lust continue to grow.  The Bollton's plot line finally came together.  I'd found this entire plot line too confusing in the season with the Roose and Ramsay and Theon plot line just mingling together.  I hadn't picked up on the Boltons in season 2 and they've played such an important role in season 3 that it would have been nice to have them play a slightly larger role earlier before becoming the fulcrum on season 3.I love the plot in the North.  Seeing Bran, Sam, and Jon come together was immensely rewarding.  I love seeing Bran develop into a strong character.  Sam is just plain awesome too.  I love his platonic relationship with Gilly.Kings Landing was awesome.  Seeing Jaime return with Brienne was really great.  I'd missed Jaime over the past couple of episodes.  I loved seeing the relationship between Tyrion and Sansa grow and the devastation that Tyrion feels when he sees that Sansa knows of her family's death.  The scene in the Small Council was truly awesome.  Tywin ruling the roost with Jofrey parading around like a school boy was delightful.    I was left a little cold with Shae's scene.  The scene with Daenarys, while necessary, was rather perfunctory in my mind. I'm getting a little tired of her making the same "free the slaves" speech and being adored.  I sort of feel that this part has been floating out in space, without a close tie to the rest of the geography of world.  I know there is a map, but I don't get the geography from the show.  Just a short scene of her discussing the plan forward would be great.   Is she planning on marching all the way back to the Narrow Sea? Anyways, an awesome episode!
s03e10	★★★★Well, I'm not going into lengthy analyses, because other people are much better at that than me. But here are some little things I liked a lot.Oh my god, they showed THAT scene after all!After episode 9 some people were relieved that not all the gory details about the Red Wedding aftermath were shown. Turns out they were wrong...Sansa smilesIt's been a while since we've seen Sansa smiling and being charming. Her scene with Tyrion finally showed a bit of the lady she was brought up to be. Of course, since we can't have Sansa happy, she gets the bad news about her brother and mother within the next five minutes.Yara has a heartI never cared much for Yara's cynism, but in this episode we finally see her caring and even going against her father's wishes to rescue Theon. I'm really looking forward to see how that thread continues.Arya and the Hound share vengeanceOf course, Arya is awesome once again, but I like how she and Sandor Clegane are growing to understand each other better. They both know what the desire for vengeance feels like, and they're both not afraid to deliver sweet vengeance upon their foes.Joffrey gets sent to bedI always love it when Joffrey is kicked around, and there's no man who can do it better than Lord Tywin himself. "The King is tired. See him to his chambers." :-)Jaime's homecomingJaime has been through a lot and finally makes it back to King's Landing. But here we see how much he has changed and how much things have changed for him. He's definitely not the cocky, arrogant bastard he was before, so I'm curious to see more of him in season 4.All in all: nice season ender. Looking forward to next season :).
s03e10	★★★★What's not to like? It felt like they did a great job of ending the season showing us where every story and character is heading. Boy that was a lot to get done over an hour, and yet it didn't feel rushed. I really enjoyed that episode.I particularly enjoyed the intense scene with Arya. That storyline is going to be awesome!The small council meeting was also epic. They really gave us what we wanted, which was confrontation.All in all every scene in this episode felt like action -> stuff was happening, that mattered.I felt like this episode plus the prior two really vindicated this season. I'd give the season overall 3 1/2 or 4 stars.
s03e10	★★★I would say this episode was so-so. It wasn't anywhere near as dramatic as The Rains of Castamere episode, but at least it wasn't abysmally slow.Some of the parts featured in this episode that I liked were:Tyrion standing up to Joffrey.Shae got some screen time, and they built up her character a bit as well.Cersei talking about how much joy Joffrey brought to her when he was a kid.These were all good buildup to some of the events to come.The closing sequence had a further glimpse of the dragons, which wasn't bad either.
s03e10	★★★★I am writing this post just to see if somebody else noticed this. There was light and direwolf at the end of the tunnel. Some hope for the Starks? 
s03e10	★★★★I'm just glad that I finally learned why Simon/Barry from Misfits was going medieval on Greyjoy and saw Arya begin her revenge killing spree. I'll be excited to see how a common enemy effects next year's dynamics and whether Dany will walk on water before she is crucified.
s06e02	(Show spoilers) It was largely a good episode. Many of the events felt a bit rushed and crammed, as though the show is impatient to get the big things done (Jon's resurrection, Ramsay's grab for power, Sansa's escape, Ayra's return to her faceless man training.) The lingering on Bran's experience with Winterfell was very nice, and it struck me as one of the few times the show took a pause.It is one thing to expect the resurrection of Jon Snow, but it is another to actually see it. The resurrection was anti-climatic as I've been waiting for this since I read A Dance With Dragons, and of course, last season. I like that it showed that Jon had warged into Ghost. It is the only way that Jon can come back and still be a full human being. I also liked the struggle within Melissandre as she decided to work with resurrecting Jon, even in her state of doubt. It showed that the power of the god worked in her, instead of any tricks on her part. A higher power wants Jon back, and we the viewers are better for that. It was a little underwhelming, but it is possible the show did that deliberately or they just wanted to get it done.Balon Greyjoy: As a book reader, I was expecting Balon Greyjoy to die. I expected to see a faceless man kill him, but it made sense to bring in Euron Greyjoy for the two men to have their confrontation. Balon looked weak next to his brother, so the death was not a big surprise. Euron looks younger than I expected him to be, but he had all the necessary sneers and bravado. Somehow he got on that island and killed Balon Greyjoy without Yara/Asha discovering his presence. I look forward to the Kingsmoot.Ramsay: I always figured that Ramsay would kill his father, but I didn't expect it to happen so soon in the season. Again, it made sense, and if anyone had any tender thoughts for Ramsay, I'm sure they disappeared when he set the dogs loose on his stepmother and his baby brother. The Karstarks who join Stannis in the books will join Ramsay in the show. I am a bit underwhelmed by Ramsay's evilness. I guess I do miss Joffery a bit. This struck me as more plot development to get to the Battle of the Bastards. And how will Walder Frey react when he hears about the death of his daughter?Kings Landing: The Ser Robert Strong business was well done as he killed the peasant man for insulting Cersei. The Jaime business with the High Septon shows that the leader of the Faithful is a very dangerous man. I call him dangerous because I think he actually believes what he is saying: he is not a hypocrite, but he is also aware of his immense power because he can lead so many people. He has a charisma that cannot be bought or intimidated. That was a nice touch when his followers appeared just as Jaime was contemplating killing him or doing something violent. The High Sparrow is going to be a huge problem for the Lannisters.Theon: I was surprised that Theon is considering going back to the Iron Islands, and I suspect it will not go well for him if he does, but he did offer Sansa convincing reasons for staying away from Castle Black as he is ashamed of how he behaved after taking Winterfell. Of course, he doesn't know what has happened to Jon Snow, and I believe Jon would forgive him because he saved Sansa. But Theon is on another arc, and the Winds of Winter released chapters suggest as much as he is with Stannis as his prisoner. Asha is also the prisoner of Stannis. So we may have seen a book spoiler.What else: Cersei still seems remarkably contained for all that she has endured recently. I suspect that will change soon. I see she still is drinking lots of wine. The Arya business was fairly predictable. I figured she would return to the fold after another round with the waif.I liked seeing Tyrion with the dragons, but I really am not interested in Meereen at all. I hope Tyrion becomes a dragon rider--I think it is a strong possibility.It was a decent episode, much better than the one last week. There was no Dorne craziness, and the shocker deaths really weren't all that shocking. I think the high points for me were seeing Bran with Bloodraven as he saw his father as a younger man, along with Lyanna and the younger Hodor, er, Wylis. The other high point, of course, was seeing Jon Snow return. I am positive he warged into Ghost and returned back to his body, once Melissandre's rituals made it safe for him to return.
s06e02	Season 6 has picked up at a vengeful, violent speed and it doesn't seem like it's stopping any time soon. Home is a turbulent, well-constructed setup episode for a thrilling season.Spoilers Ahead. Speculation on theories and book events.Beyond The WallBran still can't walk, but his hiatus has gifted with the ability to see visions. And these are some RICH visions! Those who don't read the books will avoid the excessive back stories, but they also miss out on some key characters.Brandon Stark. Lyanna Stark.  To get a brief glimpse of these legends for the first time on screen (even just as kids) gave me a little heart flutter of what's the come. With the ending of the episode, I am more than convinced that this season will show the infamous Tower of Joy scene.King's LandingThe most compelling thing about Game of Thrones is it's ability to weave your emotions in such a complex knot that you simply cannot escape. The Lannisters, who were the most despicable people ever to live two seasons ago, have grown into a pitiful collection of the dead and the incestuous. Strong, surprising performance from Tommen in his emotional scene with Cersei. We are reminded that past Cersei's monstrous existence, she is still a vulnerable mother.Jaime vs. The Faith Millitant? Sufficiently teased.MeereenNo Danaerys, but there's plenty of Tyrion one-liners to really drive home how screwed everyone is in Essos. The slavers have taken back the bay, thanks to the Khaleesi's piss poor leadership and chained dragons.The dragon scene was surprisingly anti-climactic, but perhaps that's because book readers were treated to much more. Something tells me that nothing much will happen in Meereen this season, at least until Danaerys comes back.BraavosArya is still stuck in her training montage. Moving on.WinterfellThe Boltons NEVER disappoint. I always knew that the struggle between father and bastard would come, but not this soon! Ramsay's cruelty comes completely out of left field, leaving him as a proprietor of rape, murder, betrayal, treason, and his latest--baby killing.Honestly, I expected the cunning Roose Bolton to have seen this betrayal coming. He was always the mastermind that could tame Ramsay's violent, psychotic actions, but not this time. It is disappointing yet liberating, unleashing a perfectly unrivaled villain out into the game of thrones.Somewhere in the NorthWhat is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger. Looking forward to Theon's return.The Iron IslandsBalon gets his long overdue bridge death. Alas, the War of the Five Kings is over!Euron (Crow's Eye) Greyjoy emerges, but doesn't have a crow's eye?The Kingsmoot is coming. I expect Yara Grejoy to be somehow fused with the essence of Victarion Greyjoy and bid for control of the Iron Islands against her uncle.Castle BlackWe all saw it coming. R+ L = J confirmed.
s06e02	★★☆☆☆[Spoilers]I have two main criticisms for this episode:The events in the North (Winterfell, the Wall and maybe even the Pyke) are moving way faster than those in the other regions. The resurrection of Jon Snow was lacking in context.Let me explain this further. At Winterfell, there seems to be a lot going on in the 5 mins. Why have the Karstarks aligned with Ramsay? When Ramsay kills Roose, the Karstark's leader barely flinches an eyelid. While the alliance between Karstarks and the Boltons seemed dubious at best, it seems surprising that they would support Ramsay over Roose. At the Pyke, the introduction of Euron Greyjoy is as confounding. His dialogues were unclear and almost comical with no context. Let's move over to the Wall now. Here are some of the questions which begs answering. Why is Ser Daavos reasoning with Melisandre to revive Jon Snow? He has had minimal interactions with Jon. Yet he is spending his nights guarding Jon's body. Why isn't he going towards Stannis's camp to see if there are any survivors or questioning Melisandre about what's happening there? Not even a single question about Shireen. How has his loyalty shifted from the Baratheons to Jon Snow so quickly?This show was however not without merit. The scene between Bran and Bloodraven was most interesting. This is probably how we are going to see the events at the Tower of Joy. And Tyrion's 'friendship' with the dragons raises interesting questions. This might be the key as to who rides the other dragons. I am glad that the resurrection of Jon Snow is done with. Now we can move to, hopefully,  more interesting parts of his arc.
s06e02	★★★☆☆Well, this episode wasn't so bad either. But a lot of things happening in it were so easy and convenient. The primary goal seems to have been the setup for future episodes, and more importantly, plot advancement by any means necessary.The rest of the review has major spoilers from Season 6, Episode 2.Bran Stark returns with a bang, in what is easily the best scene of the episode. They have switched Bloodravens, but it's still a poor old man caught in the branches of a stubborn shrub. It was Eddard and Benjen sparring in the show version, while it was Lyanna beating Benjen with sticks in the books. For a moment there I thought sideburns was Brandon, wondering why he was so much older, only to realize that it was a young Rodrik Cassel. I like that Lyanna was introduced on horseback, with her brothers groaning at her to not be a showoff. I was shocked to see Hodor there, not just because he was speaking normal words - I always thought he was much younger, in his early twenties perhaps. And they are calling him Willis/Wylis instead of Walder - because, you know, the show watchers might confuse him with Lord Walder Frey. All of this was happening the practice yard of Winterfell, not the godswood - Bran has undergone enough training that he doesn't need a weirwood nearby to see what has happened. This is how we'll get to see the Tower of Joy, I'd expect. The scene ends with Bran saying something that I was personally thinking:You finally show me something I care about and then you drag me away.King's Landing was... interesting. We see a random peasant drunkenly mocking Cersei while the others around him start to get uncomfortable, and then Robert Strong comes to smash his head in. Cersei is very subdued, quietly resigning to her chambers on hearing that Tommen doesn't want her leaving the Red Keep. In the Great Sept of Baelor, Jaime has a confrontation with the High Sparrow, and comes out of it thoroughly beaten. Tommen has gone over to Cersei now, asking for her help to bring down the sparrows, and it's not going to end well.The other Lannister sibling is hearing about the dragons' hunger strike, and decides to free them. Curiously, the dragons don't eat him - or roast, or even singe him - and they didn't really leave? I'm not exactly sure what happened there. No Dany this week, she's travelling. We get two quick scenes of the Stark sisters, one at Braavos where the blind beggar girl gets a beating once again before the kindly old Jaqen H'ghar takes her back, and one in the north where Theon is saying goodbye to Sansa. When he said home, does he mean Pyke? Or is he going to Winterfell so he can try and kill Ramsay? I think it's the former, because kingsmoot is coming.The introduction of Euron was not that great, and without the terrifying tales about him, his boasts were rather hilarious. The last of the Five Kings to war for Westeros is dead now, and at the end of his funeral it was made clear that there will be a kingsmoot. We know Asha is going to be there, and Euron, and maybe even Theon would reach in time. Perhaps Theon will be given Victarion's task, wouldn't that be a surprise?The most shocking part of the episode was probably what happened at Winterfell. Ramsay commits patricide, step-matricide and half-fratricide without blinking an eye. Of course, I should have seen this coming, and I know quite a few who did, but I was really expecting the reverse - that Roose would recognize the threat and have Ramsay silently killed. Oh well, another main family line has been destroyed. There was a number of reveals before the stabbing though - someone has killed the sixth Bolton soldier that Brienne et al missed, Ramsay was dropping the Umber and the Manderly names, and there is a Karstark son still alive! (I know Harrion didn't die in the books, but still.)Finally, the Wall. We were warned it was going to be bad, though: "I have never been much of a writer. Apologies for what you're about to see." When the attempt on Jon happened in the books, Castle Black was already at chaos, and it's really hard to guess what was going to happen - two factions of the Night's Watch, a large group of wildlings, the Queen's Men, and an angry giant were all there, and I still can't think of what's going to happen there. But the show, though, made it all a joke. I've already written two answers (one, two) about the resurrection being underwhelming, but even before that we saw the chaos die down quietly. Alliser has men breaking down that door, with Davos and the others getting ready for a fight, the wildlings arrive, and then it's over. Alliser is arrested, and I suppose some of the other conspirators would also be thrown into cells until Jon can behead them. Sigh.Overall, this was a very mediocre episode with a lot of missed opportunities and desperate attempts at adding shock value while botching the actual shocks. 6/10.
s06e02	Obviously, spoilers inbound (though if you've managed not to get spoiled thus far you deserve some kind of medal).How do I feel about S6E2: Home? 10/10, would gladly watch again. This is easily the best single episode in several seasons. Unlike many GoT episodes, I didn't feel like a single scene was wasted or unimportant. We covered a lot of ground, without feeling rushed or hurried. Each moment was given its due, and boy, were there a lot of moments.The episode started off by retroducing us to Bran, who was excluded from season 5. They quickly established his ability to see the past through the trees and all but confirmed that this is how they will reveal Jon's parentage with the introduction of young Lyanna Stark.The Iron Islands are not my favorite plotline, and I honestly haven't much missed them for the last two seasons. That being said, their scenes were some of the best of the night, particularly the scene with Balon and Euron on the bridge. I had been wondering for some time if Euron and/or Victarion were going to make a show appearance, and this answered that question for me. It's also wonderful to see Yara back, and I cannot wait for the kingsmoot which presumably will occur within a few episodes.We finally got to see Tommen, and he's finally gaining character depth. Essentially, he feels like a powerless coward, and he knows he needs to grow a spine to be an effective king. (Problematically, he thinks his mother is the best one to teach him this).We also got a fun little confrontation between Jaime and the High Sparrow. Jaime's interaction with the High Sparrow presents a nice contrast to Cersei's. Unlike her, most of Jaime's major sins are out in public and well-known already, and he has little to hide (other than his ongoing affair with his sister).Sansa and Theon were oddly touching, and I'm so glad Sansa now knows that she is not, in fact, the only living Stark. Speaking of which, Arya's training is definitely moving quickly enough to satisfy my need for plot development (if perhaps a little too quickly to be believable). Then there was Tyrion and the dragons. Oh, man, this was so good. I really really want Tyrion to end up with a dragon, and the story he told about wanting a dragon as a child just made me want it even more. Seeing him with Viserion and Rhaegal would have been touching if it wasn't also terrifying. I look forward to seeing Tyrion with the dragons again.Let's not forget Winterfell and the Boltons either. Just when you think Ramsay can't get any worse, he kills all of his remaining family. If I had one quibble with this episode, it was that I can't imagine politically-savvy Roose ever getting so close to Ramsay immediately after he gets disinherited without checking him for weapons - and in that regard, I wasn't terribly satisfied with Roose's death. But it did have to happen, and the follow-up with Walda and her son cemented Ramsay as worse than Joffrey for me.And finally...the Wall. Hoo boy. We knew it was coming, everyone has been calling it for months, but seeing it in action was something else. First, Dolorous Edd returned with the wildlings, then Davos persuaded Melisandre to give resurrecting Jon an attempt. I'm a big fan of how they're handling Melisandre this season; unlike prior seasons, she is incredibly vulnerable, her faith shattered. Her vulnerability makes her more accessible and (I feel) more likeable.The ending scene was handled perfectly. Just...perfectly. I wouldn't have changed anything about it. It was completely appropriate that Jon and Ghost be alone when Jon woke. This is the episode I wanted as the season premiere. It got me jazzed up and excited for the show in a way I haven't been for quite some time. I can't wait to see Jon confront his killers next week!Unanswered Questions:For the love of the old gods and the new, WHERE is Petyr Baelish?So, can Rhaegal and Viserion get out now that they're unchained? Because that could be interesting.Where is Sam? I find it odd that we haven't seen GRRM's analog yet, given how many other plots we've touched on.Is Dorne just going to be written off and ignored now? (Please say yes. I can't take it anymore).Originally appeared on my blog
s06e02	SPOILERs ALERT!★★★★★ For the fans who believes in their fan theory of Jon's resurrection!★★★★☆ - Because they make happen it so ealry in season 6.NorthJon Snow’s resurrection may have been the big reveal of tonight’s episode, “Home” [coming for Jon Snow] but there was a many more going on in the episode.Jon Snow (Credit: HBO)The Red Priestess tries her best to resurrect the Jon Snow from dead, at the behest of Davos. She thinks she’s failed. They all think she’s failed. But then, as Davos leaves the room, we see Ghost stir. He senses something, just like I knew he would. Why else would they keep showing him sleeping beneath Jon’s pallid corpse? Then, with a gasp, Jon Snow’s dark eyes open.  We were right all along. Jon was dead, but he’s alive again.North of the Wall, Bran Stark has visions of his father and uncles and his aunt Lyanna as children play-fighting in Winterfell. Hodor is there, though they call him Willas, and he can speak in words other than “Hodor.” Curiouser and curiouser. I have to say, it’s no accident we see young Ned and Lyanna the same episode Jon Snow is brought back from the dead.Meera, for her part, seems jaded and restless, but the Child of the Forest assures her that Bran will need her. “He won’t be in there forever,” she tells the girl.Bran talks briefly with the Three-Eyed Raven and Meera, but not a lot happens here.And there we have the title of the episode. Now that we have it, let’s not tarry any longer. The White Walkers are about. Let’s fly south :D :D WinterfellBut before we go inside the castle, let’s listen in on these travelers we spy from above. One is a lady knight, too tall and broad to be a proper lady, with a shock of short, blond hair. Brienne and Sansa talk briefly about where to go, and Brienne asks Sansa what happened to her while in Winterfell. Sansa says she should have gone with Brienne when she had the chance, but Brienne is gracious. “It was a very hard decision,” she says. They speak of Arya before Sansa goes to check on Theon.Poor Theon, he’s a wreck still. He can’t go to Castle Black because Jon will surely kill him for his crimes against the Starks. “I won’t let him,” Sansa says. “I’ll tell him the truth about Bran and Rickon.” But Theon doesn’t want to go, doesn’t even want to be forgiven. What of the other truths? What about the farm boys he killed? What about his betrayal of Robb? No, Theon will ride West to the Iron Islands. We’ll go there, too, but first the castle.Here, Roose Bolton speaks condescendingly to his crazy bastard son, Ramsay. Ramsay wants to attack Castle Black and kill Jon (who he doesn’t know is dead…or, uh, alive again I guess.) Roose says that if you act like a mad dog, you’ll be treated like one. Taken out back and slaughtered for pig feed. Torrhen Karstark stands nearby, ready to pledge his sword to eliminating the Starks since Robb beheaded his father.And just at that moment, in walks the Maester with news that Lady Walda has had a baby boy. “Don’t worry, you’ll always be my firstborn,” Roose says to Ramsay. “Thank you father,” Ramsay replies. “That means so much to me.”Then he stabs him to death. Some commenters said last week they thought Ramsay would kill his father. I thought it was too easy a play. Roose is clever, would always expect such a betrayal, and would be prepared to turn the tables on his bastard. He’s played everyone else like a fiddle, why not Ramsay, too? This is where my predictive powers took a nose-dive, I suppose. Roose is dead, “poisoned by our enemies” according to Ramsay.The following scene…poor Fat Walda. Her poor baby. Ramsay is a cruel prick, that’s for sure. I can’t wait for Jon Snow (or maybe Sansa Stark?) to put a sword through his eye. Joffrey may have deserved a poison goblet; Ramsay deserves a blade.The Iron IslandsHere Yara and Balon Greyjoy are arguing the merits of invading the mainland. She’s against such a foolish, pompous venture. He’s the last of the five clashing kings, and thinks that in and of itself is victory enough—a sign to keep on fighting for no good reason. Yara reminds him that the last time they tried this, Ned Stark knocked down his castle, killed two of his sons, and took Theon hostage.Balon storms out, walking out into the rain on the most frightening looking rope bridge I can imagine walking across in the middle of a storm. A shadowy figure stands on the other side. It’s Euron Greyjoy, Balon’s little brother. Euron is insane and cruel and arrogant, and says it’s his time to rule and Balon is in his way. Naturally, he throws him from the bridge into the rocky sea below.They send Balon’s body out to sea, and Yara swears she’ll exact vengeance on whoever killed him. The priest reminds her that she isn’t the ruler, that this will be decided at the kingsmoot, where the Iron Islanders pick their next ruler. “Maybe you’ll be the first woman to rule the Iron Islands,” he tells her, doubt in his voice. Euron may have a thing or two to say on the matter, in any case.If we keep flying we can leave the dreary islands behind us, and head to wear it’s warm. It’s just a bit south by south-east this time, and there…the red keep is off in the distance.King’s LandingHere, the Lannisters are trying their best to regain a footing in the tumultuous capital. The Sparrows are still exerting far too much control, but there seems to be little anyone can do about it. At best, Cersei is exacting a petty sort of vengeance on the people who mocked her in the streets. The guy who flashed her is boasting about it in his cups. He goes to relieve himself and Cersei’s zombie knight, the resurrected Gregor Clegane, smashes his head into the wall. The violence is almost comical.Jaime and the High Sparrow have it out in the High Sept, over the body of Myrcella. The High Sparrow really is a cocky little man, and I think far too self-assured. He reminds Jaime that his people have nothing to lose. No wealth, no families, no names, and yet together they can “overthrow an empire.” Sure, the man deserves credit for making some pretty savvy moves against Cersei and Tommen. But Cersei is a terrible leader and Tommen is a boy. Notice, the High Sparrow didn’t make any plays against Tywin Lannister when he was alive and Joffrey was king, nor against Robert. He’s slithered in during a time of chaos and made some very good political power plays.Will Jaime be duped as easily? If nothing else, I think Jaime will be a great deal more bold than Tommen. And if he musters the Lannisters and the forces of King’s Landing, he should very easily wipe the Sparrows from the map.Let’s leave the Seven Kingdoms altogether, spreading our black wings out above Blackwater Bay, heading east and north across the Narrow Sea, until the spires of the free city of Braavos come into view beneath the clouds.BraavosHere, Arya Stark tells the man we know as Jaqen H’ghar three times that “a girl has no name” even as he tempts her with food, shelter, and her sight. “Come, follow me,” he tells her, instructing her to leave her beggar’s dish. “A girl is not a beggar,” he says. Thank goodness we don’t have to see Arya get beat up again by that other girl, who seems to take the whole thing far too personally to be “a girl with no name” herself.MeereenVarys and Missandei (Credit: HBO)Here, Tyrion reminds Varys and the others that dragons cannot survive captivity. Dany’s ancestors rode on dragons accustomed to ranging for hundreds of miles. They conquered Westeros with those dragons. But their descendants chained up their dragons, until they were no bigger than cats. Until they went extinct.So, perhaps because he is well into his drink, Tyrion ventures down into the vast dungeon hall where Daenerys has chained two of her dragons, Rhaegel and Viserion, and frees them. They’re intelligent creatures, he reasons, and they’ll realize he’s their friend. “How do you know this?” asks Missandei. “That’s what I do,” Tyrion replies. “I drink and I know things.”So, torch in hand, he reaches out to the two captive dragons.“I’m here to help,” he tells them. “Don’t eat the help.”He also tells them how he wanted a dragon of his own, and cried himself to sleep when he discovered they were all dead. “And yet here you are,” he says.It’s a great, tense moment. I didn’t really think the dragons would eat Tyrion—even for a show used to giving us big, shocking deaths, this would be a bit much—but it’s still scary. When Tyrion rushes away up the stairs, Varys looks at him with a look of shock. It’s quite the expression coming from the usually cool and collected Spider, whose typical emotional range runs between smug and faux concern.Good for Tyrion to free the dragons, though we don’t yet know how they get out of the palace or what happens next.Let’s skip flying and just fast-travel back to…Castle BlackDavos is really the central hero here. In the beginning of the episode, he and his companions and Ghost ready themselves to fight against the vile Alliser Thorne. Just when all seems lost, Eddison Tollett shows up with the Wildlings, led by Tormund Giantsbane. One giant smashing a Crow against the wall and tossing his broken body aside convinces the rest of the Night’s Watch to lay down their arms. Alliser is arrested and the good guys, for once, triumph over the villains.This is the second piece of good news in Season 6, following the rescue of Theon and Sansa by Brienne of Tarth last week. But it’s not the last.Once again, it’s Davos who comes to the rescue. He champions the idea of bringing Jon Snow back from the dead to Melisandre, who has lost faith in her Lord of Light. If he hadn’t been there, she wouldn’t have bothered, and they would have burnt his body beyond all revival.VerdictI’m still sort of processing this episode, to be honest, though I found it gripping and intense for the most part. Jon Snow coming back in the second episode is amazing!Ramsay killing Roose Bolton was also pretty intense, and opens the door for all sorts of madness in the North. Big, scary things are afoot.And I loved the scene between Tyrion and the dragons—especially since it has implications beyond the dragons simply being intelligent. Did they favor Tyrion for other reasons? What it might be as this Jon Snow's resurrection by Red Priestess fan theory came true like that another fan theory that says, "Tyrion Lannister could be a Targaryen."?There’s plenty of time for speculation before next week’s episode. For now, I'm keeping fingers crossed... Thanks for A2A Monu Kamble 
s06e02	I thought it was a lot better than the last episode. The scenes had a lot more meat to them and there was nothing really terrible. I found it to be much better written. I didn't recognize the writer's name: he must be new.I have two nitpicks: the obviousness of the Sansa storyline: it's clear that my prediction that Ramsay will recapture Sansa, who will be the 'bait' for Jon Snow to come rescue her. Quite aside from the most Un-GRRM like plot turning that represents, I just wish their foreshadowing wasn't always so heavy handed.The other scene I had a problem with was Arya's. How did that even make sense? I saw no evidence of any test being passed, yet Arya evidently passed it. Tyrion freed the dragons, as everyone predicted. A lot of fuel has been put on the fire of the "Tyrion as dragon-rider" theory. Some people will be upset, but in fact, most fans have long believed that to be an eventuality.(But are dragons really smarter than humans?)Winterfell scenes were very well-done, I thought. By far the best acting that Ramsay-actor has been allowed. Of course it was horrid, but we all knew it was going to happen. I was a bit disappointed at Roose Bolton's going out with a whimper. Evidently, Roose Bolton is a man to be undone. King's Landing was great. I mean, I hate what they've done to book Cersei, of course. But they sold it to me. There were a lot of moments of genuine dramatic tension that they managed to solve without a stupid death. Kudos. They are growing.Jon Snow: My main quibble is about Davos being there in the first place. It's hard to find his motivations, pecially after the Wildling cavalry has rescued him. And the eventual reawakening was, well, a bit cheesy because it was more-or-less expected. I mean the execution of it. The long lingering shot and the wakening gasp. I'll give it a 4/5 for TV. It ain't the books, but it's good enough that I can temporarily forget about them and accept it as a newer and dumber, though still entertaining story.
s06e02	The second episode takes up the arduous task of keeping the story going as it brings back older plot lines. Game of thrones is back and it is back to killing people and bringing others back?Bran Stark is still training as he visits the early days of his fathers childhood as we are introduced to Lyanna Stark for the first time in the series. The scene is cut short as Bran tries to explain the usefulness of the cave exploration to Meera who is still grieving from her brothers death. Kings Landing is still reeling from the walk of shame as they prepare to honour Myrcella. Tommen feels guilty for being incompetent during the events that have transpired across the Kingdom as both his wife and Mother are imprisoned. We get glimpses of the monstrosity of a reanimated mountain as he bashes the skull of a man into the wall. Jaime is ready to die to keep his word as he finally confronts the man who is set out to take down his family. Has he said too much? Ramsay Bolton is dangerous as ever. His failures have piled up as he let Sansa and Theon get away. Wada Frey has a baby and it is a boy. Rose Bolton reassures Ramsay that he would always be his first born. Ramsay isn’t happy after the threat from last week. He doesn’t leave  anything to chance as he wipes out the rest of the Bolton line to become the Warden of the North. He is headed to Winterfell to take on Jon Snow and claim the North for himself. Sansa and the gang are on their way to the Wall. Theon isn’t happy with going to the Wall. He knows Jon Snow will kill him for the betrayal. He embarks on a journey back to home the Iron Islands after giving a heartfelt speech about how he’ll always be loyal to the Starks.Mereen has grown impatient under Tyrion and Varys as they wait for their Queen to return. The other nearby lands that Dany freed are back to normality as the slaves are returned to the slave owners. Tyrion frees the dragons to ensure that they live till the Queen gets back and also to satisfy his own curiosity. He is able to free them without causing much damage. The show has done a great job of replacing Quentyn with Tyrion in this aspect. I expected Tyrion to die, but I guess the show runners know what the fans want. As Theon begins his journey back to his home, we go back to the Iron Islands. Balon Greyjoy is old and disheveled. He isn’t sure about what to do with his Kingdom next as he isn’t quite hopeful for any of his heirs. He meets his long estranged brother the Crows Eye on the bridge after which he plummets to his death. The show has done a great job of introducing 3 of the 4 brothers as the Iron Islands prepare for the Kings Moot. Melissandre the Barber, gives the dead Jon Snow a good haircut. Ser Davos gets her going with a good pep talk. He is probably frustrated with the number of murders she has committed in the name of sacrifice without any results. After a dramatic chanting to get him back from the dead Melissandre gives up only for a dramatic ending with Jon Snow waking up. 
s06e02	As there are several summaries floating around of this episode, I shan't delve into it and just present my views on how this episode shaped up. Resurrection of Jon. Seriously, HBO?! Of all the lovely ideas floating around, including some brilliant stuff speculated by fans, you have an atheist Ser Davos pep-talk Melisandre into trying to resurrect Jon. So uncharacteristic and totally anti-climactic. I knew this was pretty much coming, as HBO wouldn't pay all that money to Kit Harrington just so that he can play dead half a season. An episode or two is all they can afford. And there you have it. Dragon Whisperer Tyrion. Well, well, well. The line should've been "I drink, I know things and I can whisper sweet nothings into vicious and captive dragons without being turned into toast". This entire sequence was bloody awesome. Especially how the second dragon offers to have himself unshackled by Tyrion. Without even growling. Well done, dragons! Time travelling Bran. This was a revelation in more ways than one, and left me wanting more just like Bran. Young Ned, Benjen and the fiery Lyanna. Wow! However, the surprise bit was a perfectly coherent Hodor/Willas. I didn't peg him to be that old, really. And  it does throw up interesting questions as to what made him lose his speech and why does he say "Hodor"? Does it mean anything specific? I think Hodor has a bigger role to play than just being Bran-carrier.Ramsay Bolton. Enough said. Roose Bolton deserved to die if he couldn't see his bastard for what he truly is. The Lady Walda, her newborn and the dogs stuff was unnecessary. We already know how terrible Ramsay Bolton is, there's no need to prove anything more. The sequence should've ended with Lady Walda wanting to see "Lord Bolton". Turmoil in Pyke. This seemed like a half-a**ed attempt to bring the Greyjoy story arc that's there in the books into the series. The Kingsmoot, and the happenings thereat, are very interesting and in my opinion should've been shown in Season 4/5. Having said that, I am eager to see the Dragon Horn that gets blown at the Kingsmoot and how and if it gets incorporated in the series. Lannisters, Arya, Brienne, Sansa, were really quite boring. Especially Arya. Hopefully she gets her sight back in the next episode. It would be great if they can show her warging into a cat before she gets her vision back just like in the books. All in all a mixed bag of an episode. It would be quite interesting to see how things pick up from this episode in the next one.
s06e02	The episodes are getting more and more predictable. They have had to really simplify parts of the books (the Dorne plot, no war/plague/siege in Meereen, no Victorian)I was not a fan of how they made Bloodraven just look like a regular old Watch member or how the Children now look. Also using the 'time machine' plot device with Bran is weak story telling. Its what shows do when they run out of ideas.Ser Davos wasn't really given a real motive to ask Melisandre to resurrect Jon. He's not religious and prior to this season did not even like Melisandre.  Didn't he even try to kill her at one point because of her necromancy? Melisandre's character has been made a shell of her former self. I think it would have been better to make her realize she interpreted the visions incorrectly and gone to Davos with the revelation and try to bring Jon back while Davos protested instead of what they did.Ramsay's plot wasn't even veiled it was basically told in the last episode.  One question I have is what is the gift going to be for Ramsay?  Will they work a fake Sansa into the plot now? Or bring back Stannis? Or will it be a Rickon hostage?They telegraphed that Sand Snakes are still lurking in Kings Landing, so Tommen's golden shroud is incoming after Cersei gets him to start a war with the Faith Militant.The rest seemed pretty standard.The best scenes are the giant rag-dolling the guy that shot him (which is basically what made Thorne and his men surrender, even though they probably would have pin-cushioned the giant as soon as he broke the doors) and Tyrion with the dragons, which I know many people will take to mean Tyrion is a Targaryen, when its clear he isn't he just treated the dragons like the intelligent creatures they are.
s06e02	[This review contains spoilers and speculation]Hodor? Hodor.The show gives us only its second flashback ever, this time in the form of a pensieve-like vision that Bran witnesses. By showing us Ned, Benjen and Lyanna, the show presumably lays the groundwork for a big reveal in later episodes but also serves up an awesome surprise right there -- once upon a time, Hodor could do more than just Hodor.You can't help but sympathize with Meera though. She's left her childhood home, braved the bitter cold, narrowly escaped being raped and seen her brother get stabbed to death, all so Bran could chill with the Bloodraven and daydream about the past.Breaker of Chains 2.0Having seen his ships burn away in the last episode, Tyrion realizes that he needs to fight fire with fire. Thankfully for him, Dany's dragons seem to have made full use of the dungeons' distance learning courses, and added the common tongue to the repertoire of languages that they can comprehend.Grateful for being freed, the dragons will no doubt help Tyrion regain control over Meereen, but the true potential of this blossoming friendship might only be realized once the trio crosses the narrow sea.Help me!After a brief period of rebellion last season against his Queen mother, Tommen relapses into his helpless child mode. The fact that his decision to deny Cersei the chance to attend her daughter's funeral was made out of concern and not spite, was a nice touch that shows little Tommen still loves (and needs) his mother.The High Sparrow's interaction with Jaime betrays his pernicious nature. Jaime's reasoning is foolproof -- if the Sparrow could humiliate his sister for her sins, why should he be spared? But what Jaime fails to see is that the High Sparrow is playing a long game. If things go as per his plan, Jaime will get his comeuppance too; just not right now.Over in Braavos and in much need of help herself, a girl with no name (psst, Arya) continues to get whipped, before passing the easiest test in the world and getting re-accepted into the House of Black and White.The dastardly bastardFor the second episode running, Thrones serves up a murder that I didn't see coming at all as Ramsay does to Papa Bolton what the latter did to Rob Stark. The murders of Doran Martell and Roose were particularly shocking because, like a lot of fans, I was expecting both to be central characters this season.But now that mad dog Ramsay has nullified all threats to his claim and is free to rule unchecked, it stands to reason that a lot more blood will be spilled before the season is over. And given the events at the end of the episode and his decision to raid the Wall, I suspect some of it will be his own.Balon's will is mootThe episode introduces Euron Greyjoy, Balon's younger brother, who promptly makes a case for safer bridges in Westeros. Balon thinks that Euron's years at sea have left him half-insane, and with the dialogue Euron was given to work with this episode, we might as well believe him.His arrival at the Iron Islands however complicates matters for Yara who will now have to ward off competition for the Salt Throne in a quasi-election, the Kingsmoot. But with brother Theon's impending homecoming presenting her with another ally (remember, she was pretty popular amongst the Ironborn), her chances of victory look good.Be prepared for Euron to play spoilsport however. It would be unlikely that the show introduces him at this juncture only to have him drift off into insignificance soon after.Lord of the Wall: Return of the NescientOver at the Wall, the real traitors of the Night's Watch are imprisoned by the returning Free Folk, which lets the focus for Davos and team shift beyond immediate damage control. After some textbook vacillating, the Red Woman accedes to Ser Davos' wishes and relieves Kit Harington of his contractual obligation to not shear his curly locks.Despite the fact that we all knew that Jon Snow had to come back, it is to Thrones' credit that it still manages to seed the slightest doubt in our minds about whether he would. The actual revival however wasn't quite the cinematic event that it could have been (but then again, given the expectations of fans following a major death, when is it ever? See: Sherlock S03E01) as having been exposed to Grandmalisandre in the previous episode, I expected her "true form" to play a role in Jon's resurrection.But anyway, enough quibbles. Jon is back! And hopefully this time around, he knows something.
s06e02	Liked it. Liked it a lot.I know some people are complaining about the means of Jon Snow's resurrection but I'm a bit unclear about what they actually wanted to occur. He's back and the implications are what's important now because it's not just about the return of Jon Snow, it's the return of The Red Woman and her change of allegiance. In the past she's been a true zealot, convinced of her own power and her own abilities and her own vision. Then for two episodes we saw all that stripped away and discovered she was just a sad old woman with a fire fixation. But now, she's bringing people back from the dead and her convictions can all be conveniently retconned. "All praise the Lord of Light. He led me to believe Stannis was the chosen king so my faith would be tested and he would lead me to the true King". She's going to go full nutcase and Jon is in her debt. This episode also promised to move forward two of the storylines that have become a bit bogged down in recent times. Arya might finally get somewhere and Mereen could become interesting again. Game of Thrones has always been at it's best when it builds up conflict and then lets it loose. And it's shown it can do large scale conflict better than any show on TV and better than most movies. This episode laid further groundwork for more conflict on the horizon. Internal conflict for the Greyjoys, conflict between Ramsay and anyone who isn't Ramsay, conflict between the Lannisters and the high sparrow, conflict between the Lannisters and Dorne, further White Walker conflict with the newly resurrected Lord Commander back in charge, conflict between the Mountain and anyone guilty of indecent exposure, conflict between dragons and anyone in Mereen silly enough not to get out of the way...Hang on, it's going to get bloody. 
s06e02	It was yet another Monday morning when I lay on my bed, my back to it, legs and hands splayed like a snow fair. First, my dog woke up in the silence of of the morning. Then, I opened my eyes and drew a long breath. Rolling in my bedsheet, I switched on my laptop with half ditsy eyes and somehow managed to fish out a decent 280 MB  torrent which would(atleast in my opinion) get downloaded in a decent time.Let me be honest here. I DIDN'T see the entire episode. I just scrolled towards the very end.The end when we see a furrowed Melisandre, crumbling under the expectations of millions of fans and few crows, that hapless look on her face which speaks i-do-this-or-i'm-fucked. And that silence that engulfs you when Davos walks out of the room housing Jon's naked body, his back to it, limbs splayed on a hard,wooden bed and none but ghost by his side. We see the camera zoom on his face. We anticipate and we KNOW what's about to happen but we wait, the final few seconds of the episode.Anything can happen.Then, all of a sudden, we see Ghost stir up. Our first thought is of Jon warging back as Ghost. Although we are happy, but happy isn't what we had expected.And then it happens.The Lord Commander opens his eyes, inhales the air equivalent to the breath all his fans have been holding for a year and comes back....There was a surreptitious trickle in my eyes which gave in to a burst of ecstatic applause, startling my roommates and scaring my neighbors!Whew! I've NEVER experienced such an adrenaline rush in my life.I guess this is some story I can narrate to my descents a few years down the lane."Grandpa! Do you know Jon comes back?""I saw it live when this happen, my child. I know."Valar Morghullis!Edit: The complete review coming very soon.
s06e02	★★★★★Spoilers!!Another stunning episode. Scene after scene of nail-biting, edge-of-the-seat drama. The sets, the script, the acting, the story-telling: wonderful. Incredibly entertaining. Bran/Bloodraven – for book fans, Bran and his mentor giving us a visual wander-through of interesting scenes from Westerosi history is mouth-watering. An actual visual on Lyanna Stark is a huge deal. Watch THAT space. The Hodor-could-talk development was unexpected. What significance this will have? Amazingly elaborate set of Winterfell’s interior. Such attention to detail. God, I love the fact they are spending so much money on this show.The Wall/TheWildlings – Top-quality action scene. Great moment when the giant whips the crossbowman off the wall, smashes him against the stones, then flings his lifeless body on the ground. Ser Alliser’s anti-Jon revolution didn’t even last two episodes. The good guys are in charge of Castle Black again.FrankenGregor/Tommen/Cersie– Great novel-death-method moment from FrankenGregor, who nicely sets out his stall for the season (i.e. killing people in unusual and imaginative ways). Tommen’s scene with Cersie is his best of the show so far. Really powerful. Asking Cersie to show him how to rule is unlikely to lead to good outcomes. If he wants to be strong, he should jolly well rescue his wife from those religious fanatics.Jamie/The HighSparrow – Scintillating dialog between these two. I was hanging on every word. Jonathan Pryce is made for Game of Thrones. He’s now verbally seen of both Diana Rigg and the Kingslayer himself. Will no one stop this man?  I have absolutely no idea where this plot line is going, or what it means. Finding out promises entertainment.Tyrion/Mereeen/Dragons– First: “That’s what I do: I drink and I know things.” Goes down as one of Tyrion’s best ever lines (and it’s up against some seriously stiff competition). Second: Mereen with Tyrion in it is much more interesting the Mereen without Tyrion. Third: unbelievable work to downing glass after glass of booze, then deciding to go and check out the starving dragons chained in the basement of your pyramid. Possibly the best seems-like-a-good-idea-when-you’re-drunk plan ever.The scene with the dragons was simply outstanding. For the first time, someone is actually attempting to productively interact with the adult dragons. I loved the moment when Viserion immediately understands what Tyrion has done on releasing his sibling’s chain, and at once presenting his own neck. These dragons are smart. Real smart. And this is the scene when they got really interesting. I hope they friends with Tyrion. And I hope he ends up riding the white one.Viserion and Rhaegal are significantly bigger than they were when they ripped apart that dude in Season 5. I’d day they were as big as Drogon was last season. So when we next see Drogon … Roose/Ramsey/the Dogs– Given Ramsey is such a naked psychopath; I’d always assumed Roose had some contingency against his mental son just stabbing him through the heart. It seems the North’s most experienced strategist overlooked that eventuality, even though the rest of us assumed Ramsey would try something like that at some point. Both this and last week’s Bolton episodes were engrossing. Shame to see the back of Michael McElhatton, who was brilliantly cast and always a pleasure to watch.Once Roose was dead, Walda had zero chance of survival. The build-up to the kennel scene was very well done and exceptionally creepy (one of the most disturbing things is how charismatic Ramsay manages to be). As for the kennel scene itself: we wondered what Game of Thrones was going to do to top burning to death a sympathetic child character in front of her parents. Well, now we know. One wonders how they’ll top a mother and baby being ripped apart by hounds. Something tells me they will.Balon/Yara/Euron –Back to the Iron Islands after a long break. Balon Greyjoy’s invasion of the north has proven a damp squid. To his daughter’s frustration he has no more imaginative plan to offer. Time to die, old man.I was full of anticipation of the entrance of Euron Greyjoy: the one-eyed lunatic pirate captain who leads his elite band of killers around the world, raping and pillaging as they go – the guy mad enough to brave the ruins of Valyria and survive, and the guy who makes Ramsey look like a misunderstood but fundamentally gentle soul. Given the brilliance a scene (storm, swaying rope bridge,massive drop) I expecting quite a lot. I’m afraid on the evidence of this one scene, the part seems miscast.Judgement will be reserved until the Kingsmoot – which should be one of the most interesting scene’s in this Series.Jon Snow revisited –That was shocking. Despite being absolutely sure Jon would come back from the dead this series, this was not how I expected it to happen. The sheer simplicity caught me off guard (Melisandre performs a ritual; Jon rises from the dead). Surely - I assumed while watching the scene – this will be a false run, and Jon will be brought back some other way? This show is moving too fast for false runs.It was another splendid, emotional scene. Melisandre’s methodical washing of the corpse; chanting in her unknown language; the trepidation-filled looks between Tormund and Davos; the shots of Jon’s dead body; the shocking resurrection itself.Reflections on Jon’s return – I was really hoping to see was some sort plotted underworld sequence. Mainly because, as an old-school fantasy geek, what I’d love a reveal about George R R Martin’s metaphysics (Life after death? What’s there? How does it work?). It does not look like we’ll get that in the show.But presumably, John has brought some boon back from the dead with him? Of knowledge, possibly? Jon’s death must have narrative significance,given it appears to be a such central plot point. Maybe Jon will reflect upon the experience of being dead, and hearing about will be spookier and more satisfying than seeing it?I have a lot of faith in the source material, and in D&D’s adaptation of it. So I expect what we learn from Jon’s death and subsequent resurrection– and the effect it has on both the character and the story – will be at least as interesting and satisfying as anything I could have thought up.Bring it on.
s06e02	Obviously, spoilers inbound (though if you've managed not to get spoiled thus far you deserve some kind of medal).How do I feel about S6E2: Home? 10/10, would gladly watch again.This is easily the best single episode in several seasons. Unlike many GoT episodes, I didn't feel like a single scene was wasted or unimportant. We covered a lot of ground, without feeling rushed or hurried. Each moment was given its due, and boy, were there a lot of moments.The episode started off by retroducing us to Bran, who was excluded from season 5. They quickly established his ability to see the past through the trees and all but confirmed that this is how they will reveal Jon's parentage with the introduction of young Lyanna Stark.The Iron Islands are not my favorite plotline, and I honestly haven't much missed them for the last two seasons. That being said, their scenes were some of the best of the night, particularly the scene with Balon and Euron on the bridge. I had been wondering for some time if Euron and/or Victarion were going to make a show appearance, and this answered that question for me. It's also wonderful to see Yara back, and I cannot wait for the kingsmoot which presumably will occur within a few episodes.We finally got to see Tommen, and he's finally gaining character depth. Essentially, he feels like a powerless coward, and he knows he needs to grow a spine to be an effective king. (Problematically, he thinks his mother is the best one to teach him this).We also got a fun little confrontation between Jaime and the High Sparrow. Jaime's interaction with the High Sparrow presents a nice contrast to Cersei's. Unlike her, most of Jaime's major sins are out in public and well-known already, and he has little to hide (other than his ongoing affair with his sister).Sansa and Theon were oddly touching, and I'm so glad Sansa now knows that she is not, in fact, the only living Stark. Speaking of which, Arya's training is definitely moving quickly enough to satisfy my need for plot development (if perhaps a little too quickly to be believable).Then there was Tyrion and the dragons. Oh, man, this was so good. I really really want Tyrion to end up with a dragon, and the story he told about wanting a dragon as a child just made me want it even more. Seeing him with Viserion and Rhaegal would have been touching if it wasn't also terrifying. I look forward to seeing Tyrion with the dragons again.Let's not forget Winterfell and the Boltons either. Just when you think Ramsay can't get any worse, he kills all of his remaining family. If I had one quibble with this episode, it was that I can't imagine politically-savvy Roose ever getting so close to Ramsay immediately after he gets disinherited without checking him for weapons - and in that regard, I wasn't terribly satisfied with Roose's death. But it did have to happen, and the follow-up with Walda and her son cemented Ramsay as worse than Joffrey for me.And finally...the Wall. Hoo boy. We knew it was coming, everyone has been calling it for months, but seeing it in action was something else. First, Dolorous Edd returned with the wildlings, then Davos persuaded Melisandre to give resurrecting Jon an attempt. I'm a big fan of how they're handling Melisandre this season; unlike prior seasons, she is incredibly vulnerable, her faith shattered. Her vulnerability makes her more accessible and (I feel) more likeable.The ending scene was handled perfectly. Just...perfectly. I wouldn't have changed anything about it. It was completely appropriate that Jon and Ghost be alone when Jon woke.This is the episode I wanted as the season premiere. It got me jazzed up and excited for the show in a way I haven't been for quite some time. I can't wait to see Jon confront his killers next week!Unanswered Questions:For the love of the old gods and the new, WHERE is Petyr Baelish?So, can Rhaegal and Viserion get out now that they're unchained? Because that could be interesting.Where is Sam? I find it odd that we haven't seen GRRM's analog yet, given how many other plots we've touched on.The other Lannister sibling is hearing about the dragons' hunger strike, and decides to free them. Curiously, the dragons don't eat him - or roast, or even singe him - and they didn't really leave? I'm not exactly sure what happened there. No Dany this week, she's travelling. We get two quick scenes of the Stark sisters, one at Braavos where the blind beggar girl gets a beating once again before the kindly old Jaqen H'ghar takes her back, and one in the north where Theon is saying goodbye to Sansa. When he said home, does he mean Pyke? Or is he going to Winterfell so he can try and kill Ramsay? I think it's the former, because kingsmoot is coming.The introduction of Euron was not that great, and without the terrifying tales about him, his boasts were rather hilarious. The last of the Five Kings to war for Westeros is dead now, and at the end of his funeral it was made clear that there will be a kingsmoot. We know Asha is going to be there, and Euron, and maybe even Theon would reach in time. Perhaps Theon will be given Victarion's task, wouldn't that be a surprise?The most shocking part of the episode was probably what happened at Winterfell. Ramsay commits patricide, step-matricide and half-fratricide without blinking an eye. Of course, I should have seen this coming, and I know quite a few who did, but I was really expecting the reverse - that Roose would recognize the threat and have Ramsay silently killed. Oh well, another main family line has been destroyed. There was a number of reveals before the stabbing though - someone has killed the sixth Bolton soldier that Brienne et al missed, Ramsay was dropping the Umber and the Manderly names, and there is a Karstark son still alive! (I know Harrion didn't die in the books, but still.)Finally, the Wall. We were warned it was going to be bad, though: "I have never been much of a writer. Apologies for what you're about to see." When the attempt on Jon happened in the books, Castle Black was already at chaos, and it's really hard to guess what was going to happen - two factions of the Night's Watch, a large group of wildlings, the Queen's Men, and an angry giant were all there, and I still can't think of what's going to happen there. But the show, though, made it all a joke. I've already written two answers (one, two) about the resurrection being underwhelming, but even before that we saw the chaos die down quietly. Alliser has men breaking down that door, with Davos and the others getting ready for a fight, the wildlings arrive, and then it's over. Alliser is arrested, and I suppose some of the other conspirators would also be thrown into cells until Jon can behead them. Sigh.
s06e02	★☆☆☆☆-Some of the most disappointing video media I've ever seen.Like others, spoilers ahead. My running issue with GoT, is a complete disrespect for the complexity of the original story. What most viewers see as shocking and surprising, I know to be sterile and in many ways banal compared to the books. I'm not just saying the usual "the books are better, waaah!", I'm talking about the basic knowledge that railroaded, cliche plots, just aren't good. Particularly, here are some utter failures in S06E02:Jon Snow:Let's kick it off with the biggest news. This scene sucked. Davos was the convincing voice for Melisandre? This is so absurd. How does a stammering, uninspiring request from someone she thinks low of convince her to reverse a recent total upheaval of faith?! This was shitty writing. I can't imagine this is how GRRM drew it up, and I refuse to accept that it is until I see Winds(If it is, I'll still be annoyed, and disappointed in GRRM). After this travesty, the idiotic hocus-pocus(Even in the after-show, David talks about how she is just trying to say the right words), was an absolute shit-show. A word on acting: both Carice(Mel) and Liam(Davos) were shit in this episode. I absolutely love Liam, and find him to be one of the highlights of the show acting-wise, but seriously he dropped the ball. Carice is always awful, but particularly bad this round. The scene was botched from start to finish. The symbolism of Ghost moving was both heavy-handed to appeal to lowest-common-denominator viewers, and simultaneously, under-sold in the cinematography department. We all knew Jon wasn't dead, and it's fine to try to trick some people into believing what they saw in this episode, but at least have some respect for symbolism. This is completely contrasting with how well shot Jon's death was. Did the Jon Snow budget dry up or something?Dorne:My frustration with the Dorne storyline in the show is not minor, and this episode was again, below the already sorry average. The treachery in Dorne was completely dull. People died, it wasn't exciting, and hardly surprising, what was shown was utilitarian and unemotional. The dialogue in all this: drivel.Tyrion and the Mereen:I adore Dinklage, and normally he can do no wrong, but honestly, his lines were delivered flatly. Additionally, the interaction with the dragons was extremely boring. I'm ready to buy that the dragons would suffer his presence, and let him unchain them; I'm even ready to accept them just letting walk out of there; my beef was with how little reaction they had. I think the common defense is to claim that they were tired and weak from starvation, but honestly, that feels like an excuse. Again, I think the writing was hugely disappointing for this scene.  Cersei and King's Landing:I love Lena in her role as Cersei, and thought her acting was fine, here, but everyone around her sucked. Dean-Charles(Tommen) is abysmal, and his two monologues were nails-on-a-chalkboard. The one saving grace in this episode was the excellent scene between the High Sparrow and Jaime. Boltons and Sansa/Theon/Brienne:The scene with Ramsay was very predictable, but mostly fine. Iwan(Ramsay) is still a phenomenal actor, and even if the lines were a little underwhelming in his scenes, he can make anything vile/terrifying. The scene with the escapees was alright, and I thought the component of Sansa forgetting the words to the Knight's creed was a nice touch--probably my favorite thing about the episode. Iron Islands:Finally.... It's about time. Looking forward to this storyline, a little nervous about certain things transitioning from the books. all in all, the writing in this show was particularly bad. In a world where the books were poorly written, this would be annoying; but in our world, where the source text is of such impeccable quality, this is beyond offensive. I am still shocked that GRRM would let people butcher his stories as they are. I would really have expected him to have more self-respect.
s06e02	The episode was good. And not in a cheerful kind of way, the game of thrones way. My rating:  ★★★★ SPOILERS AHEAD. First off, the resurrection of Jon snow was beautiful. The best way an episode ends is by some shocking event, and this is perfect. I can't wait for the next episode, when everyone's down thinking Jon's dead, and he walks into the room. (Maybe they'd be even fighting or saying stuff like "I'll stab him again if I have to", and Jon has a dramatic entrance)Arya! Finally her days of begging are over. Or maybe it'll get even worse. All in all, her story, even though moving at a glacial pace, is taking new turns. Good.Sansa and theon. They've made peace. I know Sansa forgave him the moment they jumped, but she expresses it for the first time. That's good because there are very few people you can trust in westeros, and Sansa desperately needs one.  (Lol too bad he's leaving)Now, the happenings at Pyke ( that's the name right?) are interesting. The iron born leader is dead. The rugged sea captain asha greyjoy is up for some challenges. looking okay-ish. Oh and theon is returning so, let's see. It might get more than okay.Now my favorite part, and the part I'm looking forward to the most this season. Kings landing! If I have to say it in one word, it's 'hell yeah!'. The Mountain crushing that drunk peasants head is one of its kind. Call me different, but I love the Mountain from the end of season 5. You know what's the true beauty of game of thrones? The character development. The characters you've desperately hated and despised in one season are going to to be one some of your favorite characters in the next. Jaime was like that. People are getting a soft corner for cersei too. My favourite is the Mountain. At the end of season 4, I hated him for killing the red viper. Cut to the end of season 5, he shows up in an armor, and covers cersei. In season 6, just the sight of him walking behind cersei is making my hair rise. Hell yeah! Try touching her now. I mean the guard actually sighed that the Mountain retreated. Bad-ass. Oh and the faith is going to be screwed. Very badly. I can see the high sparrows future written on his face. The three eyed Raven said there'll be a war. But he didn't say where. It's at the south lads, not north. Dorne is going to attack kings landing. And there'll be an internal war too, when the faith is destroyed. The only hope for lannisters are Tyrells this time. Cause there is no wildfire, there is no Tyrion or tywin. Maybe Keval Lannister will help. Whatever it is, lannisters have to be ready. Oh and did we talk about how awesome Tyrion is? He wanted a dragon as a pet! And now he have got one.I think Danny and Tyrion should seriously get together. how cool would that be? 
s06e02	4 stars out of 5.  I really enjoyed "Home." It was way, way, way better than the first episode of Season 6.  I loved the scenes with Bran and Bloodraven.  Those were some of my favorite scenes in Game of Thrones of all time.  I've always liked Bran's storyline the most because he's he only character who feels like he's on a quest to save the world; everyone else feels like they are just playing in the mud.  Seeing the young Hodor (did he stop speaking when Lyanna died?) and the young Ned was awesome. I enjoyed the zombie Mountain wrecking shit.  I want to see him pull apart the Faith Militant limb from limb.  How awesome would that be to see him take down those sanctimonious bastards?  I didn't like the scenes with Tommen.  The actor playing Tommen is rather ineffectual, especially when sparring with heavyweights like Lena Headey.  The High Sparrow's scene was okay, but really predictable.  I wish Jaime had followed his arc from the books -- slowly becoming a good person rather than retreating into the orbit of his mentally deranged sister.I was truly shocked by Roose Bolton's death.  I liked his character.  He was basically a wilder version of Tywin Lannister: Incredibly smart, ruthless, and a genuine power player.  And both of them got killed by sons who they only grudgingly accepted.  Karma?Ramsay has always been a sadistic maniac, but killing his stepmother and baby brother takes that to a whole new level.   I was thoroughly shocked.I'd say my only quibble was that Balon Greyjoy's death felt like it was added to this episode unnecessarily.  Part of the problem is that the Iron Islands, much like Dorne, are largely ignored by the TV show, so anything that happens in them -- even big things like coups and assassinations -- doesn't have the same emotional impact of, say, Roose Bolton's death or the Red Wedding.  I like the fact that the dragons don't seem to hate Tyrion.  This of course strengthens the theory that he will ride a dragon.  But either way, it's great to see them free to wreak havoc and fire on the world.I loved the way that Jon's resurrection was handled.  Melisandre had been a pretty annoying character with her sanctimonious bullshit.  She always felt like a con artist, even though we'd seen her pull off some big-time magic in the past.  But now she was stripped to her core essence, and pulled off arguably the biggest feat of magic in the entire series.   Bravo to her.  I was so excited by this event concluding the episode that I could hardly sleep after watching it.Let's hope the rest of the season is as good as this episode.  "Hodor."-Hodor
s06e02	Well many people here have shared their opinion about how they felt about the latest episode, that is why I am not going to through with that again. But, I would like to bring your attention to something that made me excited!First of all- Did anyone of you felt weird that House Karstark, House Umber,etc are supporting House Bolton to rule the North and yet I get the feeling that they are plotting and pitting House Bolton against itself?As many of you must have been familiar with the theory of "The Grand Northern Conspiracy" https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/...After watching the latest episode where Ramsay Stabs Roose Bolton and I felt that there was no expression from Lord Karstark present during the aftermath. This means two things:-Lord Kartark knew Ramsay was going to kill Bolton which means that all the Northern houses were in on this coup.2. Lord Karstark is a member of the conspiracy whose main aim was to pit Roose and Ramsay against each other so that they would become weak and finally they will rebel with Jon Stark (Robb Stark made Jon heir to Winterfell according to this theory) leading the charge against Ramsay.As the series is progressing I am getting more and more convinced that The Grand Northern Conspiracy is indeed true.What do you guys think about it? Please comment and share your views.
s06e02	Rating: 4/5Here is something I found amazing about the episode:The episode is called "Home", now relating this concept of Home to the characters,Bran: Saw Winterfell, even though in a past tense, he refers to wanting to spend more time there.Jon: He just returns, nothing too much there.Tommen: Feels he's been doing something wrong and wants to fix it, and be strong for his mother.Arya: She is taken off the streets, to the only place she thinks she belongs currently.Greyjoys: Balon's brother returns to the Pyke to take want he wants.Melisandre: She doesn't know about Jon yet, but her faith returning is surely a boast to her character.Theon: Wants to get back  to the Iron Islands again.Ramsay: Tries to eliminate anyone in his path to create something of his own.The way the characters are matched to the concept of home in their own perspectives is pretty brilliant.The WallThough the come back of Jon Snow felt too predictable, it reflects a side of Ser Davos. Ser Davos, I believe, is an skeptical agnostic character, this quality of his, helps him to question everything while keep his hopes high for a miracle or rather, just a way to deal with things. Him getting Melisandre to try to revive Jon is a huge boast to this nature of his. This also shall boast Melisandre's faith and belief accordingly.King's LandingTommen  stops Cersei from visiting Myrcella's funeral. Jamie, while dissatisfied with Tommen's reaction to the whole Cersei scenario, makes him visit her. While Jamie is visited by the High Sparrow to just remind him how the city has changed since Jaime has been on his trip to Dorne, the tone is quite mildly threatening but shows the powerful side of the High Sparrow. On the other hand, Tommen lets out his worries for Cersei and his feeling of being insufficient as a king. We see an eager Tommen to make the difference from here on for the love and sarifice Cersei has provided to all Lannister children.MeerenTyrion feels lost with no good news from the council and hence decides to be a smartass he is. He tries to confront the dragons with a tale form his children and ends up setting the dragons free of their chain, we don't see the dragons exiting the chamber but Tyrion soon realizes he may have just done something with a stomach full of wine.Iron IslandsThere is mystery visitor to see Balon Greyjoy, they have a very interesting talk over the suspended bridges between two towers at the Pyke. Soon, the vistior, Balon's brother, lets his thought known and gives Balon the death he deserves. Later, Yara promises to find the killer and avenge the death of Balon. She realises she doesnt have the support yet to be the next ruler of the Iron islands, little does she know her uncle is here for the same.WinterfellRamsay shows how he's the next Joffery. We see Roose Bolton discussing with a Karstark and is mad at Ramsay for losing out on Sansa. Ramsay proposes plan to attack the Night's Watch and kill Jon Snow, to which Lorn Bolton compares Ramsay to a 'mad-dog' that he is. Soon, the maester announces the birth of Roose Bolton's new child, who is a boy. This threatens Ramsay and he ends up killing Roose Bolton pretty much the exact way Roose killed Robb Stark, karma at work. The Karstark standing there the whole time isn't surprised at all. He then moves on to take care of Walda Bolton and the new born, using his hounds to take care of the two, we see a crazy smirk rise on Ramsay's face. The hounds aren't as useless as them seem then, cause they totally ran out on Brienne.Somewhere north to Winterfell, Sansa has forgiven Theon and wants him to know she shall stand by him even if Jon doesn't. Theon decides to part ways with Sansa and return home to the Pyke now that he has repaid for all his has done wrong. Overall, it was one of those episodes where we realize how the show is not juts made up characters like Jon, Tyrion and Daenerys, but also some suporting characters who tend to contribute a lot to the main characters.
s06e02	Beware of Spoilers, milords and ladies. I thought it met the standards set by the previous episode.Visit most characters, do not expand their plotlines in any conceivable ways, with just one hurrah moment to mark the episode's airing.Bran visited what had to be the most useless memory possible; where he watched Ned, Lyanna,Ben and Hodor as kids.  I guess it's been proven once and for all that Hodor is not a teen in the show (PS that was a joke). That memory is sweet, but doesn't say much. What iI mean is, a season and an episode without Bran and this is his reentry? Not very good.I wanted to watch the Arya bit in detail so II mostly skipped that, but her insistence that she was "no one", despite the offer of restored eyesight was well done.Ramsay killed Roose. Didn't see that coming. Not so soon, not so sudden.Tyrion is trying Quentyn's trick. Hope it works better than it did for Quentyn.So the show finally says that both Astapor and Yunkai are independent of Dany. Oh, and slaving again. We don't get Quentyn's unique viewpoint of what that independence brought with it, so it's just a detail. I'm not really into the Tyrion arc this season. Yet. With luck it avoids a Dornish sidetrip.I didn't watch the Lannisters' bit closely either but I do like what I see. Cersei is trying to fight her way out of her corner, Jaime had a little confrontation with the High Sparrow. And Sansa. Alive and well. Theon too. And not dying of Hypothermia. I thought she and Theon waded through a river?Finally, and most interestingly. Jon is alive. Without any pomp and show, whatsoever. The anticonspirators' climax came remarkably out of the blue, keeping pace with a fast moving episode. In seconds, the Night's Watch is suppressed. I guess it helps to have a giant on this side of the Wall. Then Melisandre just mutters the Red Priestess mantra, nothing happens for a bit. Then Jon Awakens. So whatever happens between his stabbing and resurrection is a mystery for now. I think that Ghost wasn't warged. Didn't look like that to me. But the interim between death and return. Did nothing truly happen? Will he execute Ser Thorne as "Jon Targaryen, First of his name"? I certainly hope not. All in all, it's not a full episode. There's something lacking.Oh well. One thing I will say is that this episode, like the previous one, is a build up. When seen as one, it leaves you wondering what's on the horizon.
s06e02	Boooo !!!!We wait in anticipation of new book and show for this moment........  we all knew it was coming.... and it could not have been done by D+D in a more dull and disappointing scene ever.Ser Davos:  Gee whiz can you use ya magic. Mel: Duh I dunno.   I have no confidence...  Wah.   Oga boggidy Bo....  see I told ya so.  I am such a failure.   Everybody leave sad.... and then the dog roll over and farts and it is done.She did not even plant him one right on the lips!!!  Snow white and the poison apple are laughing at this.Terrible that the book did not come out first.   The producers think we were too dumb to follow the way it should have been written.  As I said Disney would have done it better.It was just plain ..... Blah.   It is like they are just going through the motions to get on with the story.
s06e02	This didn't redeem the show's many book departures, but  the Iron Islands look to be more interesting then the pregnant pause that was Dorne. The sooner we brush that area of Westeros off the better. That being said, I'm glad to see Bran and Hodor again. Also, I really liked watching the flashbacks, even if I had to go meta to see the point of it.The Wall was fine. I like the Wall it's big. I loved the scenes with Mel and Davos, it made up for everything else that was lack luster. The wall has always been kind of boring to me anyway.  The theme of Mellisandre being cold and vulnerable was awesome because it really showed a human side of the priestess and I want to see more of that.Winterfell was a finally moment for me. We've seen Ramsay be flippant, cruel, and brutally effective. However he's never gone full psychopath that we know Book Ramsay has gone. Until today that is!  Ramsay  has always been a mad dog, and will be bent over like one soon enough, but now lets revel in the full on psychopath.  The show has been too scared to show us his true nature, but has finally succeeded in letting the handsome petulant Ramsay with daddy issues into a full on serial psychopath he deserves to be.Kings Landing is boring and will spice up when they finally decide to give us a direction. Everything KL is filler as far as I'm concerned until they actually decided how the humiliated Cersei will strike back, and whether her brother will remain her sword and lapdog.Khal Moro and the five greatest things were missed and exchanged for a scene of Tyrion having his mary sue moment to pet the dragons. Is petting a dragon one of the sixth greatest things in the world?Honorable Mentions:Zomg! Jon Snow is alive.  As a book reader can we please move on from that.Sansa asking about her sister was sweet. Arya is truly no one now, or is she?
s06e02	Sunday night’s episode of Game of Thrones ended with a bang, confirming years and years of fan theories and undoubtedly making TV viewers the world over jump with joy.Jon Snow is alive, brought back by Melisandre, the Red Priestess, at the behest of Davos. She thinks she’s failed. They all think she’s failed. But then, as Davos leaves the room, we see Ghost stir. He senses something, just like I knew he would. Why else would they keep showing him sleeping beneath Jon’s pallid corpse?Then, with a gasp, Jon Snow’s dark eyes open.There was a moment when I thought, “Ah, this is cruel. They’re putting yet another fan theory to rest, in the most protracted, painful way possible.” But no, we were right all along. Jon was dead, but he’s alive again.To be fair, we don’t quite know what the implications of this are. Will he be like Beric Dondarrion, the Robin Hood-esque rebel knight of the Riverlands who’s been brought back to life countless times by his very own Red Priest? Or will he be changed in some other, perhaps darker way like a certain character who never joined us in the TV show, but whose ominous and vengeful presence was felt rather poignantly in the books?Source:- 'Game Of Thrones' Season 6, Episode 2 Review: Home
s06e02	For the first time the series went towards the norm, meaning what was expected out of it, Melisandre reviving Jon Snow. Frankly speaking, I have loved the books and the series because of the vicissitudes it always carried. I am glad that Jon is back, but am disappointed cause it was too clinched.  The best part for me was watching young Ned, Benjen and Lyanna. I have always loved the Starks and wanted answers to Lyanna's and Rhegar's chemistry. Bran's walk down the memory lane was my only motivation to read ahead in A Dance With Dragons. We will indeed see a lot of surprises through his greenseeing. 
s06e02	I Liked the episode but it did feel a it rushed.Emilia Clarke did say that it's gonna be like season 4 where everything just keeps happening but I didn't expect to cover up have the things we saw in GOT S6 Trailer 2.I liked Bran's vision and they finally introduced Lyanna Stark so I guess R+L=J is gonna happen. Next Hodor has a name Wyliss. I guess we're soon gonna know what trauma happened with him.Arya still getting beat up. Bored me.Sansa Theon's teary goodbye was a bit emotional.No sign of Dany. Good thing.Tyrion playing with the dragons then getting scared in the end was thrilling. Guess he might just ride one of them.As for the Jon Snow resurrection thing, I expected a bit more TBH. Melisandre just said some incantations to bring him back. I hoped more. It's clear that he was warged into Ghost. 
s06e02	Is nobody going to talk about Melisandre actually being an honest-to-god hag? Is that something were just not going to bring up again?I thought H'gar was deadWill someone rid me of this turbulent psychopath?!What's up with the tree girl?Did the faith militant cut her balls off?Apparently Deus ex Machina is spelled "W-I-L-D-L-I-N-G" nowThree castles connected by shitty rope bridges and you're telling me with a straight face that he's the first important person to have "fallen" off...Well, we all knew that was coming. Having been stabbed before, I'd be very upset if you brought me back to life in a world with no vicodin.
s06e02	Very rapid pacing, which is sort of typical of episodes 2 to 5 from other seasons as well. The season premiere was for tying up some cliffhangers, while also getting us back into the flow. The second acts as if it has to make up for the languorous pacing of the first by careening at breakneck speed down the mountain.Are they setting up Ramsay Bolton as some sort of arch villain? It sure feels like that, where in the books he is quite psychopathic but doesn't seem like nearly as much of a threat outside of his own sphere of influence.Also, that "surprise ending" has to be the least surprising surprise ever. (I think I'll have a heart attack and die from not-surprise!) I suppose I was moderately surprised that Jon wasn't warged into the wolf, biding his time, because the wolf seemed as downcast as any of the humans until it happened.
s06e02	The motto of this show has been the same since the very beginning. When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. Sometimes, just when it seems like winning is right around the corner, it turns out to be a nasty case of death instead. Westeros is a land where good, honorable people die terrible deaths, and also a land where despicable people die terrible deaths as well. Generally, everyone dies a terrible death. Valar morghulis.North-Jon Snow’s resurrection may have been the big reveal of this episode, “Home” but there was a ton more going on in the episode.North of the Wall, Bran Stark has visions of his father and uncles and his aunt Lyanna as children play-fighting in Winterfell. Hodor is there, though they call him Willas, and he can speak in words other than “Hodor.” Curiouser and curiouser. I have to say, it’s no accident we see young Ned and Lyanna the same episode Jon Snow is brought back from the dead.Meera, for her part, seems jaded and restless, but the Child of the Forest assures her that Bran will need her. “He won’t be in there forever,” she tells the girl.Bran talks briefly with the Three-Eyed Raven and Meera, but not a lot happens here. I did love the Three-Eyed Raven’s line when Bran gets upset for being taken from his vision. “It’s beautiful beneath the sea, but if you stay too long you’ll drown.” (Or something to that effect.)“I wasn’t drowning,” Bran shoots back. “I was home.”And there we have the title of the episode. Now that we have it, let’s not tarry any longer. The White Walkers are about. Let’s fly south to…Winterfell-Brienne and Sansa talk briefly about where to go, and Brienne asks Sansa what happened to her while in Winterfell. Sansa says she should have gone with Brienne when she had the chance, but Brienne is gracious. “It was a very hard decision,” she says. They speak of Arya before Sansa goes to check on Theon.Poor Theon, he’s a wreck still. He can’t go to Castle Black because Jon will surely kill him for his crimes against the Starks. “I won’t let him,” Sansa says. “I’ll tell him the truth about Bran and Rickon.” But Theon doesn’t want to go, doesn’t even want to be forgiven. Theon will ride West to the Iron Islands. Here, Roose Bolton speaks condescendingly to his crazy bastard son, Ramsay. Ramsay wants to attack Castle Black and kill Jon (who he doesn’t know is dead…or, uh, alive again I guess). Roose says that if you act like a mad dog, you’ll be treated like one. Taken out back and slaughtered for pig feed. Torrhen Karstark stands nearby, ready to pledge his sword to eliminating the Starks since Robb beheaded his father.And just at that moment, in walks the Maester with news that Lady Walda has had a baby boy. “Don’t worry, you’ll always be my firstborn,” Roose says to Ramsay. “Thank you father,” Ramsay replies. “That means so much to me.”Then he stabs him to death. Roose is dead, “poisoned by our enemies” according to Ramsay.The Iron Islands-Here Yara and Balon Greyjoy are arguing the merits of invading the mainland. She’s against such a foolish, pompous venture. He’s the last of the five clashing kings, and thinks that in and of itself is victory enough—a sign to keep on fighting for no good reason. Yara reminds him that the last time they tried this, Ned Stark knocked down his castle, killed two of his sons, and took Theon hostage.Balon storms out, walking out into the rain on the most frightening looking rope bridge I can imagine walking across in the middle of a storm. A shadowy figure stands on the other side. It’s Euron Greyjoy, Balon’s little brother. Euron is insane and cruel and arrogant, and says it’s his time to rule and Balon is in his way. Naturally, he throws him from the bridge into the rocky sea below.They send Balon’s body out to sea, and Yara swears she’ll exact vengeance on whoever killed him. The priest reminds her that she isn’t the ruler, that this will be decided at the kingsmoot, where the Iron Islanders pick their next ruler. King’s Landing-Here, the Lannisters are trying their best to regain a footing in the tumultuous capital. The Sparrows are still exerting far too much control, but there seems to be little anyone can do about it. At best, Cersei is exacting a petty sort of vengeance on the people who mocked her in the streets. The guy who flashed her is boasting about it in his cups. He goes to relieve himself and Cersei’s zombie knight, the resurrected Gregor Clegane, smashes his head into the wall. The violence is almost comical.Jaime and the High Sparrow have it out in the High Sept, over the body of Myrcella. The High Sparrow really is a cocky little man and far too self-assured. He reminds Jaime that his people have nothing to lose. No wealth, no families, no names, and yet together they can “overthrow an empire.” Sure, the man deserves credit for making some pretty savvy moves against Cersei and Tommen. But Cersei is a terrible leader and Tommen is a boy. Notice, the High Sparrow didn’t make any plays against Tywin Lannister when he was alive and Joffrey was king, nor against Robert. He’s slithered in during a time of chaos and made some very good political power plays.Braavos-Here, Arya Stark tells the man we know as Jaqen H’ghar three times that “a girl has no name” even as he tempts her with food, shelter, and her sight. “Come, follow me,” he tells her, instructing her to leave her beggar’s dish. “A girl is not a beggar,” he says. Thank goodness we don’t have to see Arya get beat up again by that other girl, who seems to take the whole thing far too personally to be “a girl with no name” herself.Meereen-Here, Tyrion reminds Varys and the others that dragons cannot survive captivity. Dany’s ancestors rode on dragons accustomed to ranging for hundreds of miles. They conquered Westeros with those dragons. But their descendants chained up their dragons, until they were no bigger than cats. Until they went extinct.So, perhaps because he is well into his drink, Tyrion ventures down into the vast dungeon hall where Daenerys has chained two of her dragons, Rhaegel and Viserion, and frees them. They’re intelligent creatures, he reasons, and they’ll realize he’s their friend. “How do you know this?” asks Missandei. “That’s what I do,” Tyrion replies. “I drink and I know things.”So, torch in hand, he reaches out to the two captive dragons.“I’m here to help,” he tells them. “Don’t eat the help.”He also tells them how he wanted a dragon of his own, and cried himself to sleep when he discovered they were all dead. “And yet here you are,” he says.It’s a great, tense moment. When Tyrion rushes away up the stairs, Varys looks at him with a look of shock. It’s quite the expression coming from the usually cool and collected Spider, whose typical emotional range runs between smug and faux concern.Good for Tyrion to free the dragons, though we don’t yet know how they get out of the palace or what happens next.Castle Black-Davos is really the central hero here. In the beginning of the episode, he and his companions and Ghost ready themselves to fight against the vile Alliser Thorne. Just when all seems lost, Eddison Tollett shows up with the Wildlings, led by Tormund Giantsbane. One giant smashing a Crow against the wall and tossing his broken body aside convinces the rest of the Night’s Watch to lay down their arms. Alliser is arrested and the good guys, for once, triumph over the villains.This is the second piece of good news in Season 6, following the rescue of Theon and Sansa by Brienne of Tarth last week. But it’s not the last.Once again, it’s Davos who comes to the rescue. He champions the idea of bringing Jon Snow back from the dead to Melisandre, who has lost faith in her Lord of Light. If he hadn’t been there, she wouldn’t have bothered, and they would have burnt his body beyond all revival.(Book readers will know that this can’t quite go down the same way in the books, which means that in the books it’s still possible that Jon Snow won’t return at all.)Sources-Game Of Thrones season 6 episode 2 review: Home'Game Of Thrones' Season 6, Episode 2 Review: Home 
s06e02	I liked it but I am starting to notice that everything (like the resurrection) is happening in a less dramatic way than a lot of us expected/wanted. I think it's probably because we have waited so long and speculated so much we built these expectations to reasonable heights (or maybe there is an implicit agreement to make the show's events slightly more conventional so the book will shines haha).
s06e02	Episode SummarySo Jon Snow’s no longer dead! But other things happened, including Ramsey Snow murdering many family members, Bran Stark fully exploring his warg powers and Tyrion Lannister trying to become the surrogate father of dragons. We also got a glimpse at the previous generation of Starks, including an articulate Hodor! There were many families floundering this week, in the absence of loved ones — which is best prepared to win the ongoing battle for power? We’ll find out in future weeks… While also waiting to discover just what state Jon Snow is now in.Read Awesome Review at 'Game Of Thrones' Season 6, Episode 2 Review
s06e02	Please go to this link to read my review of GOT Season 6.All fans must be happy! But don't forget this is Valar Morghulis!!- Game of Thrones season 6Peace!
s04e08	★★★★★No Spoilers:Wow.This was an amazing episode.   There were numerous major plot lines that were advanced.The reason why I gave this a 5 star is because it finally advanced Sansa into a real character who is understanding her environment and advancing her own interests. The ending battle between the Viper and the Mountain really was beautiful and a shocking conclusion (even though I knew the rough outlines of the plot).The speech that Tyrion gives is amazing in the dungeon with Jaime. Peter Dinklage is really becoming a signature actor of our age.
s04e08	★★★TL;DR review:Depending on the amount of screen time, the episode should be named 'Pillar and the Stones' instead of The Mountain and the Viper.
s04e07	★★★[Spoilers, and some gloating about a prediction]Who would have thought Mr. "We cannot choose who we love" would express contempt at his brother for loving a whore. That being said, Jaime's exchange with Tyrion was indeed golden, and reaffirmed their deep fraternal bond despite all the gloom and doom. This scene surprised me because it portrayed how Tyrion's call for combat last episode was not in fact another one of his well-devised plans but rather an impulsive move that could have gone horribly wrong had the Red Viper not intervened. But more on that later.The show tries to serve us some gore immediately after, but unfortunately Game of Thrones seems to have recast a lovable little contestant from "World's Strongest Man" in place of the horse-beheader from season one.Some more disappointment follows in Essos as the episode anti-climaxes heavily on the Dany-Daario romance, and shows me Daario and Melisandre when I wanted Daenerys. I took half a star away for this. However, Jorah and Daario's awkward morning-after scene was one of two absolutely hilarious scenes in this episode. One has to wonder if Dany's short-term strategy of keeping all her commanders happy (sorry, not all - Barristan still hasn't come into the Queen's good graces) will breed jealousy or worse in the future.The episode's weakest scenes are the ones with Melisandre and Lord Snow, despite the former making us wonder what the future holds in store for little Shireen. On a related note, what has the Thenn has been doing all this while? Eating Ygritte?The first Sandor-Arya scene was a lot of ado about nothing, but the later one was beautiful. I am a little scared for the Hound though. We have already lost one fierce warrior to a festered wound.The show once again lets two side characters play pivotal roles as Hot Pie and Podrick give Brienne's search new direction.Bronn characteristically serves up some cool lines and gives Tyrion the simple mantra to a blissful life in Westeros - I like you. I just like myself more. What made this scene particularly poignant for me was Tyrion trying to put up a brave face right before clutching on to Bronn's hand in what was a desperate, final plea. Enter Prince Oberyn. His "your sister" quip was the second scene this episode that had me in splits. A beautiful anecdote later, the Red Viper, accompanied by heroic background tunes, announces himself as Tyrion's champion and gives both Tyrion and me a major fist pump moment.By this time, I had begun to wonder where our Mockingbird was. Sansa slapping Robin had me worrying about her fate, but Paedo-Petyr intervenes. Sansa's happiness at Baelish's proclamation that he killed Joffrey because of the love he had for her mother, quickly turns to shock as he kisses her moments after telling her she should have been his daughter.The ending scene however was far too predictable. Sansa flying would have been a certified OMG moment; Lysa, less so. You even see Baelish's revelation about his life's only love coming, and this probably takes off another half a star from the episode.Alas, 14 days to the next episode.
s04e07	★★★★★An enthralling episode.Spoilers Alert!The Trial Before CombatNaturally that is the first thing we want to see happen. But not yet. Tyrion finds it difficult to arrange for a Champion. Jamie backs sighting his one hand. Bronn proves the evil bastard he is when he reveals Cersei had bribed him by arranging to marry him with Lolly Stocksworth and the possibility of him inheriting the Castle. But Peter Dinklage rules the dungeon scenes. His minute expressions of delight and hope and desperation while trying to persuade Jamie and Bronn to fight for him was really impressive. That statement "Oh! You are the Golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand and **** your own sister" shows how desperate Tyrion has become losing his practicalness.The MountainHafþór Júlíus Björnsson or "Thor" as the Mountain is strong and gigantic. His wikipedia page says he has been one of the World's Strongest Men for the last couple of years. But will he win the trial? He seems slow to be such a fearful warrior. And his introduction (of killing terrified unworthy civilians) is not that terrifying at all. I was reminded of the old bollywood Villain intro scenes where the Villain would kill a man just to show the audience that he is a Villain. Not effective. Let us see how he fights in the trial.Arya the PhilosopherArya is evolving. They encounter a dying man and engages in a philosophical conversation before the Hound killing him by stabbing his heart. When Arya says "Nothing isn't better than anything. Nothing is just nothing", it sounds as if she started looking life at a colder way. My favourite statement for the week.They learn that the Lannisters had kept a bounty on the Hound's head through Rorge and his friend who were trying to capture the Hound. The Hound breaks the other man's neck while Arya stabs Rorge precisely in his heart imitating Hound's killing of the elderly man. Every man has his story and the Hound too proves to have a soft heart. A heart that once longed for his brother's love. He reveals how his face was burnt by his brother for allegedly stealing his toy. Touching, logical but a little boring.The Knight's WatchJon returns to the Knight's Watch bringing the news of Mance's army approaching and they will reach before full moon. He recommends to seal the tunnel as they are already 100,000 men strong and the Watch won't be able to withstand the Giants. But Ser Alliser in his usual way teases Jon and puts him to guard the Wall until Full Moon refusing not to seal the tunnel. Khaleesi's funDaario visits Khaleesi and encounters Ser Jorah on his way out. Oh boy Oh! You should definitely look at the jealously on Ser Jorah's face. In the discussion following, she informs him of her decision to send Darrio to retake Yunkai from the rebelled Slave Masters and to execute them. Jorah persuades her to teach the Maesters of good things rather than killing them citing his own example of how Ned Stark changed his life.BrienneBrienne and Pod encounter Hot Pie in the inn and hearing that Arya is still alive, Brienne shifts her search towards Arya. Pod on the other hand seems to be thinking clearly when he points out that they shouldn't too vocal about Starks in a Lannister Land.Oberyn the SaviorThen comes the much awaited sequence of the episode. I was expecting things to come to this from the way the last episode ended. Cersei had blocked all the routes of Tyrion hiring a champion and the only way for the trial to happen is Tyrion fighting for himself. But the arrival of the Mountain to the Capital should alerted everyone. Seeing the chance, Oberyin who has been waiting for the chance to avenge her Sister's rape by the Mountain comes forward to be Tyrion's champion. But  the recollection of his visit to Casterly Rock when Tyrion was a just born and how Cersei ill-treated the just born Tyrion was a really intense scene.Sansa and her Ill fateSansa encounters her first snow after leaving to the South. Eventually Petyr kisses her while her Aunt Lysa witnesses this and threatens her of pushing down the Moon Door. That witch is mad. She gave no ears to Sansa's claim that it was only Petyr who kissed her and she withdrew. Petyr comes into the court asking Lysa to let go of Sansa but he himself pushes her off the Moon Door. Sure Lysa is a mad witch but I won't say she is evil. It was Petyr who used her for his purposes and finally kills her throwing down the door. What will happen now? Had Robin witnessed this? What will happen to Sansa now? Will Petyr marry her? Lots of questions .
s04e07	★★★★For the most part, this was one of the better episodes of the season, even if it did have a couple of low moments. Spoilers if you haven't watched this episode yet.First, the things that should have been said by the characters this episode."I sell my sword, I don't give it away. I am not your bloody brother."                                                                                                      - Bronn“My sweet silly jealous wife,” he said, chuckling. “I’ve only loved one woman, I promise you.” Lysa Arryn smiled tremulously. “Only one? Oh, Petyr, do you swear it? Only one?” “Only Cat.” He gave her a short, sharp shove.Book readers' disappointments aside, this episode was fairly fast-paced, going through significant moments in many different story lines.King's LandingNothing happened there that isn't related to the next episode, The Mountain and the Viper. I thought all of Tyrion's visitors had great things to say - Jaime's disappointment, Bronn's indifference, and Oberyn's thirst for vengeance. I was surprised when Jaime said, "You loved a whore", and I am glad that he didn't take it any further. I didn't expect the name of Lollys Stokeworth would be mentioned in the series, either. But the scene with Oberyn was incredible. Most notably Tyrion's reaction to the flashback.  We also got a small (yeah) measure of the Mountain - introducing the new actor cast in the role, as well as reminding us of the monstrosity that he is.The RiverlandsThe recap of this episode showed Rorge and Biter, and I was sure they were going to do something expected this episode. I never expected Arya to kill Rorge off like that - I really don't like the way they are rushing things with her. Biter bites a chunk off the Hound, and we see more of the dynamic between Arya and the Hound. Or Sandor, I should say, as we witnessed the human, vulnerable side of his, remembering his family. Brienne's visit at the Inn is advanced considerably - A Feast for Crows territory, though I guess it didn't matter because Rorge/Biter are already dead. Their interaction with Hot Pie was fun to watch, especially that we see how naive Brienne is, dropping the name of Sansa at will. Hot Pie's return with a pastry direwolf 2.0 helped Brienne change her mission parameters, and in spite of her smugness, Pod is the one who's thinking clearly.MeereenDany and Daario. And Daario being sent to Yunkai. This episode really is rushing into things. We see an escalation in Dany's character, who had given the order to kill all the Wise Masters of Yunkai, just like that. At least it's a good thing that she still listens to reason when Jorah shows it to her. The WallAlliser Thorne isn't going to heed Jon's warnings. Nothing new there. I think that scene was included just so we won't forget what's coming. As if we would.DragonstoneThis was a waste of running time. I am not going to talk about it. Well, except that I fear for Shireen. What did Melisandre mean?The EyrieIt opens with Sansa's first snow since she rode down south. This is the closest she had even been to home in a long time.We see how much she misses it from the way she rebuilds Winterfell, if only in snow. Robert Arryn shows he's still that same willful child who wanted to see Tyrion fly, but Sansa's slap was a surprise. And Littlefinger taking advantage of Sansa was not. Lysa finally pays the price for trusting the likes of him.Overall, I will give this four stars as a watcher (maybe three as a reader), it was almost as good as last week's episode, in my opinion.The preview for the next episode shows the much awaited trial by combat, after Theon's taken to a Moat Cailin the size of Casterly Rock, more Sansa at the Eyrie, and the wildlings arriving at Mole's Town. The only horrible thing about that preview, is that we won't get to watch the episode for two weeks this time.
s04e07	★★★★Obvious spoilers for those who haven't seen the episode yet.Mockingbird is another one of those "filler episodes" that sets up a lot of different things and ends with a long-expected climax. It absolutely didn't disappoint, and it had some great acting and character development. I wish they would have spent more time with the titular character Petyr Baelish, though. We only get to see him in the last 9 minutes.In this episode, we see a lot of the aftermath of Tyrion's trial, as he desperately tries to find a champion to fight for him in his trial by combat. And after he has to give up on Jaime and Bronn to come to his rescue, he gets his hopes up by a very unlikely champion, in a scene that's brilliantly acted by Peter Dinklage and Pedro Pascal.Arya and the Hound have some great scenes together (as always). Arya learns from the Hound as he teaches her where the heart is (which she immediately brings into practice). And the Hound opens up to her by allowing her to treat his wounds. They are starting to bond more in every episode, which is great.At the other end of the world, Dany is having a one to one with Daario Naharis, after which she sends him to take back Yunkai and kill all the masters. I have to say that I don't really care for the Dany/Daario romance plot, but I do like the conversation that she has with Jorah. He convinces her to be lenient and to spare the masters.Brienne and Pod are still on their merry quest to find the Stark sisters, as they are helped by a familiar face. It's great to see Hot Pie again! :)And then we finally get to the titular plot in the Vale. It involves one scene I was dreading, and one I was looking forward to. The dreadful scene is the one where Petyr is hitting on Sansa. Sure, they made Sansa older in the show, but he still comes across as a pervert. I literally shivered when I watched this.The scene I was looking forward to, comes right after that. Lysa threatens to throw Sansa out of the Moon Door for kissing Petyr. But he intervenes, comforts her and tells her he only loves one person. You guessed it... Cat. And out of the Moon Door she goes!Ding, dong, the witch is dead! :)So all in all, Mockingbird is a decent episode with some nice little moments and some great payoffs. Looking forward to the next episode!
s04e07	★★★★Good:Severus Baelish.Obe-win Martell.Jorah Mormont's friendzone face.Lysa Arryn should win best annoying actress (in a good way).Sweetrobin getting Sanslapped.The case of Shireen Baratheon, future First of Her Name.Hot Pie. Made me think of Gendry.Rorge and Biter.The Hound's sob story.Bronn and the story of Lollys Stokeworth. So glad they removed the part of Lollys getting bangbused during the riot in King's Landing, making her pregnant with an unknown father.Bad:No Thrones next week.Braavos in the opening credits, no Braavos in the show.Gregor Clegane the Faceless Man and the Gratuitous and Ultimately Useless Slaughters (for the sake of "oh look, he's scarrrrry") Bowen Marsh the new Faceless Man becoming Othell Yarwyck.Rorge and Biter. Brienne's arc will seem rushed with them dead.Anything with Khaleesi.
s04e07	★★★I like writing short reviews; everybody else seems keen on writing a college research paper on each new episode which, I think, is overkill for people who have already seen what has happened. Killer ending (no pun intended), but the pacing of each show is exhausting. There two scenes that really stand out; the last one, and the one where the Prince of Dorne volunteers as Tyrion's as champion. Everything else just seemed really.....eh to me. Compared to another HBO show, Veep, Game of Thrones really struggles with maintaining my active interest in what is happening on screen. There are moments where the pacing is a lot better, but damn, there is so many "character development" scenes that I'm twiddling my thumbs and checking my phone during the show. I'd like to blame it on the ADHD, but c'mon, it's HBO...Because I now watch these shows mainly on HBO GO now, I literally skipped ahead of the scene with the Scarlet-headed women*, as well as the Khaleesi/replaced-actor thing.  *Am I the only person who doesn't know the names of any of the supporting characters on this show?
s03e07	★★★★Contrary to the other reviews, I enjoyed this one - it had some great dialogue and explored a lot of the key romantic relationships in more depth.First and foremost was Jaime and Brienne. Obviously the whole dynamic there has been one of growing respect, and maybe even love, between these two characters who we've really seen grow through their interactions with each other. I certainly could not have imagined Jaime doing something so heroic as he did in last night's episode last season, yet it seemed natural here. Their shared glances last night were great.I also really enjoyed the fallout from the Sansa/Tyrion pairing, namely in his conversation with Bron and hers with Margaery. Any episode that features Tyrion and Bron chatting it up is worth an extra star alone and this one didn't disappoint. I've also shifted from being a Sansa-disliker (hater is too strong) to being really interested in her growth as a character. This episode was that turning point for me. Obviously she's still all about the princess bling, but her growing friendship (and it seems genuine) with Margaery is becoming really interesting.Then there was Robb and Talisa. Obviously this was a plot-movement point, with the birth of a new potential heir, but the captivating moment for me was seeing Kat's reaction to their interaction. This is no time for love, there's a war going on, you can hear her say with her icy stare. Listen to your mother! On mother's day no less! Obviously her relationship to Robb is evolving as she grapples with him being an adult, prone to rash decisions.And last night's episode also saw harsh reality infiltrate the infatuation of Jon Snow and Ygritte. I still love the way she says his name with that Irish/Scottish accent, Jon Snow, but we saw their sworn loyalty for each other come up against jealousy and practicality with a lot of open questions: Will Jon Snow help attack Castle Black? If he doesn't side with Mance, will Ygritte's loyalty to him disappear, contra her promise? Will she die in their doomed raid, leading to an 0 for 7? Will a concerted effort by Orell be the nail in the coffin of their now-tenous relationship? What was at one point the strongest connection now seems to face long odds.In terms of non-romance-driven dialogue, there was Tywin and Joffrey, which I thought was one of the highlights. You could see Joffrey straining against the constraints that have him limited to being a simple figurehead to Tywin's machinations. And as the audience, we know he's right! Tywin obviously has the upper hand by miles, but I actually think Joffrey might bring things to a climactic head at some point - this was the beginning of that conflict, a conflict that will obviously draw in Cersei, among others, for an inevitably interesting conflict of interest..Tying up loose ends: Theon - awful, as usual. I have hated every scene without fail.Tyrion/Shae - I actually found her a bit cloying here.Dany - This episode set the stage for what I think will be an interesting confrontation - either that or another victory in her gathering snowball of freed slaves and dragons.Gendry, Bran and Arya - Still alive.Game of Thrones is about power, obviously, but also about people as human beings and the inherent conflict between these two poles.See, for example, the Robb plotline, the Jaime plotline, the Tyrion/Shae plotline, etc etc. I mean, Varys being a eunich is far more than coincidence as is Littlefinger rising up by running a whorehouse. Ultimately, some episodes will hit the power/politics dynamic more while others will be more about the interpersonal interactions.If you're focused on the political intrigue alone, there wasn't much for you in this episode. As Marc Bodnick notes, "talk, talk, talk."However, if you're interested in the characters and their relationship to each other, particularly the romantic component, then I thought this was really good episode.  Heck, even some of my favorite French movies are just talk, talk, talk... :)
s03e07	★★★This episode was not my favorite. It felt bloated without a lot of progress.  In fact without the ending scene I would have given it a 2-star rating.There are several scenes with Jon Snow.  These felt relatively flat this week and really seemed like rehashes of previous scenes.  The one that had some tension and passion was the one where Jon described to Ygritte how they would never win and you could see how me really cared not to lose her in battle.  There was another scene between Ygritte and the Seer which had been dealt previously with by longing looks and probably could have been kept that way.Arya's temper finally got the better of her and she ran away and right into the hands of the Hound.  I don't know why, but I feel that she is safer with him than with the Brothers Without Banners.  Perhaps this is reading too much into his quasi-chivalrious behavior toward Sansa.We see Melisandre trying to convince Robert Baratheon's bastard son that he is of noble lineage and him resisting.  We get the feeling that he is going to  get behind it like all the Baratheon boys and to his own doom.  His better judgement is telling himself not to believe it.  He probably should. The scene between Margaery and Sansa was nice.  It shows Margaery has the most sense of anyone under 30 years of age.  Sansa is continuing to be written as if she is half the age that she is.The scene between Shae and Tyrion also was a dud.  I'm tired of her playing pissed off.  Either she gets that Tyrion loves her or she doesn't.  If she doesn't believe it, she needs to get the f' out of dodge, asap.  I mean really.  It's like she came down with a pissy case of Sansa-itis. The scene between Joffrey and Tywin is pretty good.  Joffrey is being his prissy-pricky self and Tywin is attempting to tell the boy to grow up.  I fear for Tywin's safety.  Joffrey doesn't give a rat's ass who anyone is if they belittle his diminutive stature.The scene with Bran in the North is a bit dull too. I understand that Osha doesn't like the kids. I know that she's afraid of what's happening.  I wish that the tension was expressed in a more dramatic way.  Her story about her husband being taken by a White Walker was compelling.  I wish that they were using these scenes to tell us more about the power of the Old Gods and perhaps having flashbacks to the distant past or into the future. Daenerys is trying to take another city.  She's getting a bit cocky.  She should move on and take a good deal when it's presented.  Don't let perfection be the enemy of good.  She wants to free all the slave cities.  But keep an eye on the prize.  You get a fleet and some bounty and now can get moving.  Taking siege to a fortified city is a big undertaking.  You should really make sure you really need it, even with a psychotically loyal eunuch army.Getting back to the same-ol-same-ol:  The scene with Robb Stark bored me yet again.  I feel like they want me to say "congratulations!  you can copulate!"   Another ol-snoozefest is the Theon being tortured scene.  I mean we all knew this was coming.  Throw in some naked girls to make it more bizarre.  I was rooting for him to really get it on for the last time, because it was so telegraphed.  But die already, would you, Theon?Okay on to the truly high point of the season, which has been the relationship between Brienne and Jaime and more generally the growth of Jaime's character from one of abject amorality to one of morality and selflessness.  Jaime is being gnawed away at by the fate of Brienne.   After Lord Bolton leaves for the Arranged Marriage Part Deux, he realizes he has a chance to take advantage of the leaderless soldiers.  He forces the return of his brigade to the keep to find Brienne defending herself with a pathetic wooden sword from a bear in an arena cage match.  Jaime, not caring for his life, since he truly believes his life is forfeit without his fighting hand, drops himself into the match and puts himself between the bear and Brienne and helps her escape.   He then negotiates the the ensuing standoff and takes Brienne. This show really has shown the dynamic range of Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.  I think he is deserves some bigger roles in movies.  He was in Mama and did a great job in a reasonable film.  I hope he continues to get bigger and better roles.
s03e07	★★★This was a 3 out of 5 star Game of Thrones episode. Game of Thrones marking is on a different scale than any other show. They have the best actors, writing, directing, the most compelling scenery and sets, excellent costumes, makeup, cinematography. This is not "2 and a half Broke Girls" or whatever. It would have been a 2 out 5 if it wasn't for the amazing, thrilling, beautifully acted last scene.This episode was in need of a big sharp pair of editor's scissors. It wandered from place to place, lingering in unnecessary spots and skipping quickly over others.I didn't realize until after that this episode was written by GRRM. It didn't seem to flow. How could it be so unstructured and verbose?  Was this a case of hero worship where none of the producers, cast or crew could or would rein him in?I would have loved to have seen a tighter version of this episode. It had so much potential. Here's what I'd do if I had the scissors.Clearer themes, threads that runs through the episode bringing disparate storylines together. Young rulers ignoring good council. Young people ignoring bad council. Mistrust and mismatches.Scene 1: Stark's base campStart with outside overview of the rainy camp. A few more lingering moments of people running through the muck. Really emphasize that people are f****** miserable. Good, realistic picture of the war dragging on. The exhaustion and ongoing grind. So much could be expressed by that scene of the rain and the mud. Then come into Robb having his hair dried by Talisa. The contrast of the outside and inside. The sacrifice and the short-sighted decisions. Keep the scene with Catelyn trying to convince them to keep going, to not be a day late and slight Frey even more. Catelyn's council is now completely dismissed. Drop the exchange about Frey being like wet shit and Talisa being OK with it, because she’s nursed people. Somehow convey that Robb seems very unsure what to do with the warplans. Save the pregnancy "What now?" for next episode or put it in a previous episode. Sub out a quarter of those scenes of Theon torture.  End this scene with the look that Catelyn gives when she turned back to see Robb and Talisa making out. Cut. Perfect. Excellent acting. End exactly there. Scene 2: somewhere in Essos, Dany et alGo to Dany in Yonkai. Contrast. Here, I have no idea where this is going. Daenerys. Not sure what to make of this. Does she feel for the slaves and/or realizes that freed slaves will make her best soldiers? Is it an excuse to be cruel? (I can’t explain this more but it’s like a righteous anger that seems a bit off target. She's playing a game to get to Westeros. Will this take her off-course? I loved the soldiers lining the road and the drum beaters going back to the wildings conversation.  The actor was too insipid and instantly unlikable for this role. I would preferred more grey, as is usual in GoT.  I also disliked this bit of dialogue “the Yonkai are proud people, they do not bend” Danenerys: “What happens to things that don’t bend?” Smirk. UGH. That rang so false. And logistically, how is Jorah who doesn’t speak Valerian and doesn’t look at all Yonkai supposed to “find out” who the powerful connections are? Approach the gate with a bag of gold? They already seem to have a lot of gold.Scene 3: Near the Wall,  the wildingsCombine all the dialogue from the previous scene walking. Make the scene about 3/2 length (instead of length of 2 scenes together). Keep the scene with Orella declaring his love – that was pitch perfect. An angry, clumsy declaration of love. Scene 4: Kings Landing, Sansa and MargaeryI enjoyed the dialogue with Sansa and Margaery. Sansa looks ashen. It's clear she's lived a very sheltered existence. She's been raised by a very moral family and, at a core level, she still believes that others play by the same rules. I believe she’s sadly knowledgeable and worldly about some hard aspects of life. I believe she is that naïve.  Did having brothers teach her nothing? Maybe she was sheltered.Scene 5: Kings Landing with Tyrion and BronYes, this was good. Brings up the issue. Creepy the justification though of marrying Sansa who is so much younger and seems so much younger and vulnerable in an uninviting way.  Bring into the conversation Tyrion's predicament. It’s an unwinnable situation. Why does he stay? Why does he feel like a Lannister when his own father and sister rejects him? The threads seem to be thinner and thinner.Scene 6: Kings Landing with Joffrey and Tywin It was not a natural, sharpest dialogue. Keep bones of this conversation and tighten it up. Loved having Tywin climb the stairs and stand over Joffrey. Power play master.<Snip >Drop the Shae and Tyrion scene. I'm not sure if it's just the actor playing Shae isn't a good actor. I've been thrown by her acting whenever she's on screen - something is off in her acting, she seems stilted. Either way, what does she want out of this situation? Does she really want him to escape with her? If she was noble born, how did she end up in Westeros. I can't tell.Scene 8: The waters of King’s Landing, Melisandre and GendryPerfect scene. And this will be on the heels of Joffrey and Tywin’s conversation to contrast the castle from the inside, the castle from the outside. The overhead view of destruction of the ships from the wildfire was magnificent. The cinematography of the scene was exquisite. The dialogue was excellent: Melisandre speaking to Gendry, connecting to him with her humble past. Giving the news to Gendry of his true parentage, explaining why the gold cloaks were after him.When she said “there is power in a King’s blood”, somehow, I don't picture her backing a bid for the Throne, more likely hung upside down to drain blood out of him. Very creepy, good delivery.Scene 9: Cave of the Brotherhood without Banners, Arya's escape. THIS, this is where I wanted more dialogue, more built up. Arya was reduced to a petulant teenager. The words were beneath her character. Escaping was very much in her character though. I felt like the Hound waiting for her grabbing her could have been laid up in a more frightening way. I don’t know how though. It makes sense that the Hound has been following them since the fight took place. Hoping that he'd have a chance to grab Arya, take her back to King's Landing and redeem himself for running away. Although with Joffrey, who knows if he’d been given mercy?Scene 10: Bolton castle with Jaime and BrienneWhat acting. The timbre of the voice, the eyes telling all. Maybe a line or two less at the beginning.  Keep the last two lines: “I will return the Stark girls to their mother. I swear it.” “Good bye, Sir Jaime”. Also, was it me or was Jaime oddly lit, almost like he had eye makeup on?<snip>Cut out most of that Bolton castle departure scene.  Just keep that Bolton is riding out to the wedding, presumably arriving before the Stark crew.<snip>Cut ALL of the Theon scene. Oh, that felt sooo good.Scene 11:  Near the Wall, Ygritte and JonYes, keep the feeling of the scene when Jon was telling Ygritte why the wildings won't win. The dialogue could be shortened. It’s clear that Jon and Ygritte isn't a well-matched love affair. It’s also clear that he’s in love with her. Scene 12:  South of the Wall, Osha, Bran, et alI don’t know why this didn’t work. Maybe it needed to be staged differently. With the actors closer together, maybe in the forest – I could have been such a good scene and yet it fell flat.  I loved Osha's backstory on her husband and the white walkers.The stunned looks on the listener’s faces.Scene 13:  South of the Bolton’s castle, JaimeInteresting backstory on Qyburn. Another grey character? Revolting methods to good means? And Jaime's comment on saving half-a-million people in King's Landing. Owning his decision. And the line "I've left something behind." was succulently good.Final Scene 14: Bolton’s castle, Jaime and BrienneEnd on that gorgeous crescendo of Brienne and Jaime walking away from the bear pit. That's pure GoT style. The bear and the maiden fair, indeed. The noblest act of Season 3: Jaime going back for his friend, Brienne.   As a person, he made a decision to turn his men back to get his friend. I won't say "rescue" - I'm not sure why. It's not a damsel in distress situation. He jumped into that bear ring to help her because she was his friend. He saw she was about to get killed and leapt in. He didn't have a plan. He didn't have a sword. He didn't have a sword hand. He just jumped right in. A huge, life-threatening risk to take. I loved that she immediately reached back to pull him up. . If this does become a romance, it’s beginning with the truest form – a friendship, a comrade, admirable. Swoon.And it looks like I could have used some editing as well - this is a LONG review.
s03e07	★★★★A more or less linear recap of Episode 7:This episode starts with Jon Snow and Ygritte on the other side of the wall. Apparently the way down is much easier than the way up, because they're already leagues away and happily hoofing it to wherever they're headed. Some folks think the dialogue here is boring, but it serves a purpose: Show how unprepared the wildlings are for the south (if Ygritte thinks a windmill is a castle, what's she going to do when she storms Castle Black?); Plant a seed in Ygritte's head that Jon Snow didn't drink the wildling cool-aid; And show us how Ygritte totally rocks the long bow.Rob Stark is getting closer to his confrontation with the Freys. It's time for the king in the north to learn how to kneel and ask forgiveness. The longer they delay, the angrier Lord Frey will become. In the meantime, though, Rob's going to log a few hours in the sack with his wife. This was very weak television, in my opinion. There is literally a solid minute of no-dialogue, no-exposition, no-anything to make Rob and Talisa's necking remotely interesting. I already have to waste 2 minutes of every episode on HBO's weighty opening credits. Why do I have to waste another on Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter's backside?BUT - the revelation that Talisa is pregnant is a huge departure from the books. Seems a bit cliche, but I'm curious to see where the show takes this. My only thought is that they're thinking pro-actively, as in, HBO might catch up to and pass George R. R. Martin's publication schedule. They're going to need something to work with when that happens.Sansa is a bit frustrating because just as soon as she appears to be growing up, she plummets back down into petulant child territory. In the books, she's 13. In the show, she's a bit older. It can be difficult to remember because she is so tall. I'm just glad she has Margaery to help her put things in perspective. As for the wedding night advice, it provided a foil for Sansa's naivete and Margaery's (possibly) more-knowledgeable-than-you-know true nature. There are some rumors in the books that haven't been discussed in the show - yet - but if they are, this scene is laying some of the groundwork. While Margaery is giving Sansa sage advice, Bron is giving Tyrion a bit of medicine, too. Tyrion shouldn't be so reticent to marry Sansa, honestly. He is more than aware of how marriage within the upper classes work. But he's torn between wanting to devote himself to Shae, and wanting to act the part of the Lord. Hopefully he buckles down and gets with the program. It's a disservice to his character to make him a worry wart.Tywin and Joffrey: in previous episodes Tywin berated Cersei for not controlling her son. This scene was interesting because I wanted to see how he planned on doing better. The results were underwhelming. Joffrey is petulant, lazy, bossy, and unpleasant. Tyrion refuses to rise to the bait, but he doesn't cowtow to him either. It wasn't lost on me that the difference between the meanings of "council" and "consult" are completely lost on Joffrey. As a side note, my friends were like "Oh no! They know Khaleesi is coming for them!" But the next scene dispelled that notion.Danaerys' scene was by far one of the strongest of the episode. We get to see her Unsullied, the Yunkish slaver, and the dragons! Dany looks more like a queen than at any other time throughout the series. And yet, she is still a young girl who wants to find surrogate children to mother in place of the children she will never have. Why else refuse ships, money, and a "hail weather!" back to Westeros in favor of attacking a well-fortified city to free its slaves? (I mean, apart from "because that's how it happened in the books")Shae is getting on my nerves. You would think that an elevated camp follower (a prostitute who makes her living by servicing soldiers) would be able to read the writing on the wall. What does she expect to happen, exactly? Tyrion is going to forswear his inheritance? They're going to run away and get married? She hasn't been paying attention. And poor Tyrion, all he knows how to do is throw his money at a problem until it stops. Jewelry isn't going to fix this.Melisandre and Gendry are sailing past Kings Landing (and magically not ruining their boat on the hulls of the burned and broken ships littering the bottom of the harbor, my sailing friend was quick to point out), and Melisandre drops the bombshell on Gendry about his father. A smart guy would get the heck away from that creepy woman, but somehow I think that's not in the cards for Gendry.Arya has less of a role to play in this episode. Lately she's been sounding like a broken record (you're not a brotherhood, you're just a lying band of thieves!). Luckily for us, she's parted ways with the brotherhood, and it looks like we're going to get our second unlikely pairing of the season: Arya and the Hound. (If you thought Jaime and Brienne was a bad combo, you thought wrong! This is round two.) But we're going to have to wait another episode to see it.Theon Greyjoy just needs to die already. Or at least make it look like he dies, so I don't have to hear about him anymore. His torture is weird, and very uncomfortable to sit through. I know why they're showing the torture, but just like I've mentioned before, if you haven't read the books then the "big reveal" isn't a good enough payoff to make viewers sit through this icky mess. Bran, Osha, Jojen and Meera are still traveling, still dysfunctional. It's a lot of talking, but it's also important to see that they're making progress towards the wall.Jaime has become the man-crush of the hour among my Game of Thrones  watching buddies. "He's so bad ass!"  "He's going to go back for  Brienne!"  "Woah, that stump is gnarly."  "Is he going to save her? Tell  me he's going to save her!"  It's really hard keeping mum around my  friends. =)  I love the progression of Jaime's character. Can't wait to  see where they take him.
s03e07	★Talk talk talk. Practically nothing happened in this episode, which is frustrating since this has basically been the story all season long. Now that we're seven episodes in, the goodwill I have toward the show is no longer enough to sustain me through another hour of nothing happening, given the latent promise of big things happening downstream. I know it can be unfair to review single episodes that really sit in the context of a holistic seasonal arc. But to simplify my perspective on this week -> I felt like you could have cut this entire episode and it almost wouldn't have mattered.Pacing issues all over the place this week.Shae, Tyrion, Sansa. Everybody talks about how unhappy they are.Bran. People talking. Theon - more torture. No movement of story, no clarification of what's going on. Joffrey and Tywin. "I'm annoyed that I can't go to the small council meeting." Yawn.Robb Stark and his wife -- rain delay. More sitting around in that same planning tent that we've been in since episode 1. Jeez are they out of budget to show Rob actually doing stuff? "We can't move our troops and get going to the wedding because it's raining."  Daenerys. These scenes were OK, but again it feels like filler to stretch out time between action.Even the Jaime and Brienne scene is repetitive. Just when Jaime is on his way, moving toward something new in his storyline, he decides to turn around and go back to save Brienne. Yes, yes, we get it -- (1) he's a changed man and (2) he feels some kind of loyalty or kindness to her. But I wish the show could establish this with more speed and drama.
s03e07	★★★This is more of a rant of the show's direction in general than an actual review of the episode.I made a prediction in my review of the first episode that this season would somewhat be a disappointment. It does not sound unlikely now. Breaking up the third book into two seasons, given the immense success of the past two seasons, made the team overconfident, thinking that there would be more space for creative delaying tactics to be had. They succeeded but somewhat succumbed to the lack of inspiration and overall direction of content to keep gripping us still.It's weird because three episodes remain and we still have, as far as I know, three missing characters -- surely even more based on the next episode's promo -- that were cast at the beginning of shooting who has yet to make an on-screen appearance. The ones I know are as follows; a slightly relevant girl of the wildlings, a new interest for Daenerys, and an enigmatic character with hands as cold as snow.If there was a single thing I could do to quell both sides of the fandom (the book readers and the not) were I part of the show creators -- and who knows why I'm saying this now -- would be to submit risk and deviate far from the source material, and to shush the united cacophony of annoying book readers. Surprisingly enough, the moments that excite me the most are those that are unfamiliar to me as a book reader. Moments like Melisandre and Gendry being together, the Olenna Tyrell and Tywin Lannister jape sparring, that one Varys-centric episode, and that one where Varys and Petyr Baelish came to a draw of ideals, and this episode's revelation of Orell's affection for Ygritte. Those stood out as perfect moments where I can truly feel that the next revelation would be stunner.The complaints echoed by many are reasonable. I, even after reading the books, do not understand myself Theon's predicament, even though I am fully aware of the sadist's identity. Still the actions that led to his downfall do not completely justify the current situation he is in. The complaint of having a neverending banter is typical of George R. R. Martin as well. It has been discussed somewhere that he dislikes writing action sequences compared to his preference of highlighting the dramatic-romantic aspect of his prose as evident in this episode as it is written by he himself. This has got to be the most romantic episode of the series, like, ever. That is indeed ironic, because the events that are about to happen in the next couple of episodes which they are building upon is bigger and better than anything he has ever come up with. These constant building up of characters are so pulling us away from the climax that, in the end, there is nothing for us to root for. This season, due to the body of this episode, has made me for the first time think that maybe, just maybe, plot is much more important than character.But, in their defence, the series is not really known for a more linear once-upon-a-time tale.
s03e07	★★★Originally posted this review as a comment.+  I think the Joffrey/Tywin meeting was really interesting. Joffrey's  spoiled reaction to where the council meetings are held and Tywin's  condescendingly patient explaining of the order of things shows the  maturity gap between the two generations of rulers and the irony that an  experienced, over-qualified leader of men is advising a child who sits  on the throne.+ For the first time in the entire show, we are  seeing a real human side to Jamie. From when we first saw him he  paralyzed the Stark boy and tried to kill him, to where we see him now  risking his own life to protect Brienne. However at times you see him  fail to learn the lesson in humility he suffered with losing his hand,  as I noticed he kept on mentioning his father and royalty as a method of  persuasion. + The Tyrion/Shae conversation was pretty strung  out and you could tell where it was going, but the conversation between  Sansa and Margery's conversation outside about Tyrion and sexuality  shows the maturation of Sansa's character, as well as a more ambigious  side of  Margery as she unconvincingly batted away Sansa's inquiry of  the source of her knowledge on the subject.+ Gendry finding  out he is the bastard son of Robert Barathien is intriguing, considering  we don't know what  Melisandre has planned for him but has implications  of big things.+ I think the relationship between Snow, Ygritte,  and the apparent jealousy of that guy who can have visions with animals  (or whatever) is pretty boring. Didn't care for any of it, and it was  predictable from the last episode that he is going to play a big part in  whatever happens to the two.+ The rainy night in the opening  scene and the troops marshaling outside contrasting with Robb Stark  & Jeyne talking about their family shows the disconnect between the  war effort and the distraction of growing a family. This tells me that  they live in their own little world while chaos exists in their own  backyard.+ The plot line involving Danarys and the new city she  wants to sack (the name escapes me) was important to me. For the first  time I'm noticing that she is overstepping her bounds, and starts to  show her lust for power. Her dialogue upon learning how many slaves live  there and her decision to use them as surplus to her army interestingly  contradicts the exterior she is keeping as a liberator of slaves. The  growth of her dragons were also very fun to see.+ I didn't care for the Arya storyline. + The only plot line that frustrates me is the Theon torture - it's just the same thing for the past four or five episodes. +  Speaking of torture, the Bran scene was woeful to watch. When she was  talking about her "turned" boyfriend choking her and started crying, I  wanted to choke myself to make the time go by faster.It was average overall in  terms of what actually happened. We saw some pretty interesting developments in Jamie Lannister, Sansa Stark, and Danarys.  Unfortunately, the rest of the episode is pretty forgettable and the banality of the other scenes  detracted from the flow of the overall episode. I wish I could rate this episode 2.5 stars, but will round up my rating to three stars because I still had fun watching it.
s03e07	★★It was a poor episode, especially so as it was written by GRRM himself. I was very disappointed with the two main scenes that looked promising: Dany in Yunkai: What's gotten into her? She seems particularly obnoxious in this episode, and her lines (the whole scene, really) seems extraordinarily made-up and dumb. And dumb. Did I say dumb? Yes, dumb. "Get out", "Find out". Emilia Clarke delivers such lines very weakly. And the actor playing mo Eraz (the Yunkish envoy) just sucks. Big downvote.Tywin and Joffrey: Argh. It was almost there, but I could feel it again, the artificialness and sheer uselessness of that scene. Poor writing - I felt that both characters, while acting well in their characteristic style, were undone by the horrible words they had to utter. It looked very forced and unnecessary. Left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth. The rest of the scenes were either boring or redundant, or both. I don't mind the lack of action, but at least make the conversational face-offs worth watching! (They're the strength of the show, IMO.)Peter Dinklage did his poorly-written bit well. Tip of my hat to him. I also liked the scene where Gendry finds out who daddy was. These two earn the episode a star each.
s03e07	★★Jay Wacker hit on all of the major plot points, so I won't rehash those. Outside of the Brienne/Jaime plotline, I was pretty disappointed with this episode. In general, it felt aimless and lacking in any major plot development. The most peculiar aspect of that, however, is that George R.R. Martin himself wrote this episode (it's the only episode he wrote for this season)! If this is an accurate snapshot of Martin's current state of writing (aimless and lacking plot development), then I'm extremely worried for how long we're going to have to wait for The Winds of Winter (unreleased book) (book six in the series).
